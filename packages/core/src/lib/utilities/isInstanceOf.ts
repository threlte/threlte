 * slower. It uses the `isFoo` property that THREE classes have to determine if
 * an object is of a particular class.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const obj = new THREE.Object3D()
 * isInstanceOf(obj, 'Object3D') // true
 * ```
 *
 * @param obj - The object to check.
 * @param type - The class name to check against.
