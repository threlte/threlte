## Rapidly Build Interactive 3D Apps for the Web

Threlte is a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) library that simplifies creating 3D apps for the web. It provides a **declarative**, **type-safe**, **reactive** and **interactive** API out-of-the-box.

Threlte's **3D rendering** is powered by [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), and it also provides a **physics engine** through [Rapier](https://rapier.rs/) and an **animation studio** via [Theatre.js](https://www.theatrejs.com/); see [packages](#packages) for details.

Check out our **[documentation](https://threlte.xyz)** and our **[Discord community](https://discord.gg/EqUBCfCaGm)**.
