Today we are releasing **Threlte 8**, a significant milestone that marks a leap
forward in performance, flexibility, and developer experience. This release has
been cooking for the last 6 months. We're super excited about the potential it
unlocks for next chapter of 3D graphics on the web.

The new features of **Svelte 5** are groundbreaking for us as developers and
embracing it was also an opportunity to refine the existing APIs. Furthermore, a
lot has been happening within the world of **Three.js**. We've carved the path
for Threlte to take advantage of those developments too.

## What's new in Threlte 8?

Threlte 8 is packed with enhancements in `@threlte/core` and updates in all our
other packages. Here are the highlights:

### All-new `<T>` component

The universal [`<T>` component](/docs/reference/core/t) has been **reduced in
complexity** all while **adding features and flexibility** that were just not
possible before.

- Props are now evaluated individually
- [`attach` got a lot more
  powerful](/docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#attach-api--trait-components)
- [Automatic disposal is more
  transparent](docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#automatic-disposal) and
- [Events have been algined with svelte 5](/docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#events)

### New `@threlte/extras` components

We've added a lot of new things to play around with in `@threlte/extras` including:
[`<AsciiRenderer>`](/docs/reference/extras/ascii-renderer),
[`<CubeCamera>`](/docs/reference/extras/cube-camera),
[`<MeshDiscardMaterial>`](/docs/reference/extras/discard-material),
[`<RadialGradientTexture>`](/docs/reference/extras/radial-gradient-texture),
[`<LinearGradientTexture>`](/docs/reference/extras/linear-gradient-texture),
[`useViewport`](/docs/reference/extras/use-viewport),
[`<HUD>`](/docs/reference/extras/hud),
[`<Resize>`](/docs/reference/extras/resize),
[`<meshBounds>`](/docs/reference/extras/mesh-bounds),
[`<Detailed>`](/docs/reference/extras/detailed) and
[`<View>`](/docs/reference/extras/view).

### Custom type support for `<T>`

Plugins such as
[`interactivity`](/docs/reference/extras/interactivity#prop-types) now expose
types which can be added to your ambient type definitions for the `<T>`
component to pick up. Event handlers and custom `<T>` component objects are now
type-safe.

### Fixed frame physics

`@threlte/rapier` now supports [fixed frame
physics](/docs/reference/rapier/framerate) letting you craft simulations with
predictability and consistency.

### Threlte plugin API

The **Plugin API** got an update to [fully embrace Svelte 5's reactivity
model](/docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#plugin-api). The doc page also
had an update to better introduce the API's capabilities.

### This is the _WebGPU_ way

Threlte 8 introduces a clear path for [using
WebGPU](/docs/learn/advanced/webgpu). Threlte requires minimal changes to
projects in order to start using three.js's new WebGPU renderer and we've also
outlined how to get started with [three's new shading
language](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language) -
TSL.

### A new package appears

An alpha release of [Threlte Studio](/docs/reference/studio/getting-started) is
part of this release ðŸŽ‰ It's a step towards visual editing; letting you tweak
values in browser and then automatically having those changes written into your
code. Theres a guided tour to help you get started. We hope it helps get things
where you want them ðŸš€ðŸ˜€

## How to migrate to Threlte 8

There are breaking changes. Threlte 8 is not backward-compatible but we've
tried our best to cover the details within our [migration
guide](/docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#threlte-8). For further help,
reach out to us on discord.

## Built with the community, for the community

This rewrite was a team effort with great contributions from the community.
Thank you to everyone who tested out any of our `@next` releases. We're immensely
grateful for the time, talent, and passion of our community. You guys rock ðŸ˜ƒ

## What's next?

We decided to deprecate the `npm create threlte` command. We're excited about
Svelte's new `sv` CLI to incorporate third party packages and we're going to
offer Threlte as a package to be installed with `sv` in the near future.

We'd love to hear about what everyone makes with Threlte 8! Take it for a spin,
explore the new documentation, and start building your next 3D application with
the super powers of Threlte 8 ðŸŽ‰
