To start using Threlte, you can either [scaffold a new project using the CLI](#scaffold-a-new-threlte-project) or install the packages [manually in an existing project](#manually-install-threlte-in-an-existing-project).

## Scaffold a new Threlte project

The easiest way to get started with Threlte is to use the command `npm create threlte` to scaffold a
new project. This CLI will interactively guide you through creating a new SvelteKit project as well
as installing and configuring Threlte and its dependencies.

```bash
npm create threlte my-project
```

## Manually install Threlte in an existing project

Threlte consists of 7 packages which can be installed and used individually. `@threlte/core` and Three.js
itself are required for all projects while the other packages are optional.
[`@threlte/gltf`](/docs/reference/gltf/getting-started) does not need to be installed separately as it
can be used with `npx`, the resulting Threlte components however require `@threlte/extras` to be installed.

### Choose the packages you want to use

{/* <ManualInstallGuide client:load /> */}

### Configuration

#### Adapt `vite.config.js`

If you are using Threlte with SvelteKit, adapt your Vite configuration to prevent `three` from being externalized for SSR by vites externalization step

```js {3-5}+ title=vite.config.js
const config = {
  // â€¦
  ssr: {
    noExternal: ['three']
  }
}
```

#### Adapt `tsconfig.json`

If you are using TypeScript, you need to add the following to your `tsconfig.json` to make sure that
the types of the Threlte components are available:

```json title=tsconfig.json {3}+
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler"
  }
}
```
