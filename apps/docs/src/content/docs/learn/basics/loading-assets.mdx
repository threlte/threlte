There are a number of different asset types you might like to use in your Threlte application. Three.js has a [ton of different loaders](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=loader) that Threlte integrates well with. You're recommended to use the [useLoader](/reference/core/hooks/use-loader) hook which will cache any asset it loads and wrap the asset in an [asyncWritable](/reference/core/helpers/utilities#asyncwritable) for convenience. Caching assets will reduce network requests, bandwidth, and memory usage, which will improve the performance of your application.

:::note
This section assumes you placed your assets in your public folder or in a place in your
application where you can import them easily.

## Models

Models come in many different formats. For example, `.gltf`'s are mostly json files. You can use three's `GLTFLoader` to load a `.gltf` model.

```svelte
<script>
  import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader.js'
  import { useLoader } from '@threlte/core'

  const gltf = useLoader(GLTFLoader).load('/assets/model.gltf')
</script>

{#if $gltf}
  <T is={$gltf.scene} />
{/if}
```

The [`<GLTF/>`](/reference/extras/content/gltf) component is roughly equivalent to the example above.

### Convenient: useGltf

`@threlte/extras` provides a handy hook for loading `.gltf` models called [useGltf](/reference/extras/loading/use-gltf):

```svelte
<script>
  import { useGltf } from '@threlte/extras'
</script>

{#await useGltf('/assets/model.gltf') then gltf}
  <T is={gltf.scene} />
{/await}
```

### Adjusting Parts and Multiple Copies

There are some challenges you'll probably run into when working with models in Threlte:

- Your model may have multiple parts that you'd like to adjust individually but there's no easy way to declaritively achieve that with only one `<T/>` component.
- The model is cached which is great but you can't seem to place multiple copies in your scene.

To address both of these issues, you can use Threlte's CLI tool [@threlte/gltf](/reference/gltf/getting-started) to generate a svelte component for your model. The generated component has `<T/>` components for all of your models parts. [Adjust the component](/learn/advanced/custom-abstractions) to your liking, then import and reused it as much as you'd like.

### Animations

Three.js uses [AnimationMixer](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/animation/AnimationMixer) to drive animations. Threlte provides a convenient [useGltfAnimations](/reference/extras/loading/use-gltf-animations) hook for gltf's. See the [three.js examples](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=animation) for how to setup a model for your animation needs.

Threlte has a few [animation examples](/examples/animation/animation-transitions) to help you get started.

## Textures

The `TextureLoader` is another loader from three that is used for textures.

```svelte
<script>
  import { TextureLoader } from 'three'
  import { useLoader } from '@threlte/core'

  const texture = useLoader(TextureLoader).load('/assets/texture.png')
</script>

{#if $texture}
  <T.MeshStandardMaterial map={$texture} />
{/if}
```

### Convenient: useTexture

`@threlte/extras` provides a handy hook for loading textures called [useTexture](/reference/extras/loading/use-texture):

```svelte
<script>
  import { useTexture } from '@threlte/extras'
</script>

{#await useTexture('/assets/texture.png') then texture}
  <T.MeshStandardMaterial map={texture} />
{/await}
```

### Multiple textures

Sometimes you'll want your materials to be composed of multiple textures. `useLoader` provides a way to load multiple textures at once and [spread](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/spread-props) the loaded textures on a material.

Loading two textures for the `map` and `normalMap` channels can be done like this:

```ts
const textures = useLoader(TextureLoader).load({
	map: '/assets/texture.png',
	normalMap: '/assets/normal.png'
})
```

or with the `useTexture` hook:

```ts
const textures = useTexture({
	map: '/assets/texture.png',
	normalMap: '/assets/normal.png'
})
```

Then spread on a material:

```svelte
{#if $textures}
  <T.MeshStandardMaterial {...$textures} />
{/if}
```

If multiple textures are given, the promise only resolves once all textures have loaded.

### Applying different textures to different faces

To declaratively apply two different textures to two different faces of a `BoxGeometry`, set the `attach` prop to a function.

```svelte
<T.Mesh>
  <T.BoxGeometry />
  <T.MeshStandardMaterial
    map={texture1}
    attach={({ parent, ref }) => {
      if (Array.isArray(parent.material)) parent.material = [...parent.material, ref]
      else parent.material = [ref]
    }}
  />
  <T.MeshStandardMaterial
    map={texture2}
    attach={({ parent, ref }) => {
      if (Array.isArray(parent.material)) parent.material = [...parent.material, ref]
      else parent.material = [ref]
    }}
  />
</T.Mesh>
```

Alternatively, mix declarative and normal three.js code like so for the same result:

```svelte
<script>
  // imports and other code
  const customMaterials = [
    new MeshStandardMaterial({ map: texture1 }),
    new MeshStandardMaterial({ map: texture2 })
  ]
</script>

<T.Mesh>
  <T.BoxGeometry />
  <T
    is={customMaterials}
    attach="material"
  />
</T.Mesh>
```

## Other Assets

Threlte provides many components to help get started with other assets (like [audio](/reference/extras/audio/audio)) but we don't have convenient components and hooks for all of them yet. Checkout [three.js examples](https://threejs.org/examples/) to see what models, techniques and effects you can acheive, then use those examples as a guide for your own [custom components](/learn/advanced/custom-abstractions).

## Async Loading

The return value from [useLoader](/reference/core/hooks/use-loader) is an `AsyncWritable` custom store. Its value will be `undefined` until the asset has loaded.

Since the underlying store's value is a promise, you can use it within svelte's await blocks:

```svelte
{#await $texture then value}
  <T.MeshStandardMaterial map={value} />
{/await}
```

These hooks can be used similarly to Svelte's `onMount` hook however assets can also be loaded after initialization by separating out the load call:

```svelte
<script>
  import { AudioLoader } from 'three'
  import { useLoader } from '@threlte/core'

  // Instantiate the loader at component initialization
  const loader = useLoader(AudioLoader)

  const onSomeEvent = async () => {
    // Load the asset when needed
    const audioBuffer = await loader.load('/assets/sound.mp3')
  }
</script>
```

Another set of tools to help orchestrate loading multiple assets before displaying something is the [suspense](/reference/extras/loading/suspense) component and hooks.

## Context Awareness

The `useLoader` hook, and other hooks like `useTexture`, use svelte contexts. The assets loaded with them are only available for child components of your `<Canvas>` component.
