Freeing resources is a [manual chore in three.js](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/How-to-dispose-of-objects), but Svelte is aware of component lifecycles, hence Threlte will attempt to free resources for you by calling `dispose`, if present, on all unmounted objects and recursively on all properties that are not being used anywhere else in your scene.

## Automatic Disposal

```svelte
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { useTexture } from '@threlte/extras'

  const map = useTexture('/some/texture')
</script>

<!--
	The geometry, material and the associated texture will
	be disposed as soon as the <Mesh> component unmounts.
-->
<T.Mesh>
  <T.BoxGeometry />
  <T.MeshStandardMaterial map={$map} />
</T.Mesh>
```

<Tip>
  Be aware that calling `dispose` on a three.js buffer, material or geometry is merely deallocating
  it from the GPU memory. If an object is used after it's disposed it will be allocated again,
  resulting in a performance drop for a single frame. It will **not produce a runtime error**.
</Tip>

## Manual Disposal

You can switch off automatic disposal by placing `dispose={false}` onto components, it is now valid for the entire tree.

```svelte
<script>
  import { T, useTexture } from '@threlte/core'
  import { BoxBufferGeometry, MeshStandardMaterial } from 'three'

  const map = useTexture('/some/texture')
  const material = new MeshStandardMaterial({ map })
</script>

<!-- will not be disposed -->
<T.Mesh dispose={false}>
  <!-- will not be disposed -->
  <T.BoxGeometry />
  <!-- will not be disposed -->
  <T.MeshStandardMaterial map={$map} />

  <!-- will be disposed -->
  <T.Mesh dispose>
    <!-- will be disposed -->
    <T.BoxGeometry />
    <!-- will be disposed -->
    <T.MeshStandardMaterial map={$map} />
  </T.Mesh>
</T.Mesh>
```
