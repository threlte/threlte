Threlte offers three different render modes to optimize the performance and
power usage of your Threlte app. Ideally, you only want to render the scene
when it is necessary, such as when the camera moves or when objects are added or
removed from the scene. The render mode determines how and when the scene is
rendered.

In the default [`'on-demand'`](#mode-on-demand) mode, Threlte is able to
determine when a re-render is necessary by observing components. When setting
the render mode to [`'manual'`](#mode-manual) you must manually trigger a
re-render. You can tell Threlte to continuously render the scene in the
[`'always'`](#mode-always) mode.

## Mode `'on-demand'`

<Example path="other/on-demand-rendering" />

In the mode `'on-demand'`, Threlte renders the scene only when the current frame
is **invalidated**. This may happen [automatically when changes are
detected](#automatic-invalidation) or the frame is [manually
invalidated](#manual-invalidation). This is the default mode and the recommended
way of working with Threlte.

### Automatic Invalidation

Threlte is able to automatically invalidate the current frame by observing
component props and the mounting and unmounting of components. This means that
when you e.g. change the position of a `<T.Mesh>` via component props, Threlte
will automatically invalidate the current frame and request a new frame.

```svelte
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'

  let x = 0

  const move = () => {
    x += 1
  }
</script>

<T.Mesh position.x={x} />
```

### Manual Invalidation

In some cases, you may want to manually invalidate the current frame because
Threlte is not able to detect changes. To do this, you can use the `invalidate`
function from the [`useThrelte`](/docs/reference/core/use-threlte) hook.

```svelte
<script>
  import { T, useThrelte } from '@threlte/core'
  import { Mesh } from 'three'

  const { invalidate } = useThrelte()

  const mesh = new Mesh()

  export const moveMesh = () => {
    // moving the mesh manually
    mesh.position.x = 1
    // invalidate the current frame
    invalidate()
  }
</script>

<T is={mesh} />
```

### `useTask`

The [`useTask`](/docs/reference/core/use-task) hook is by default configured to
automatically invalidate the current frame **on every frame**. This means that you
can use it to animate your scene without having to manually invalidate the
current frame.

```ts
import { useTask } from '@threlte/core'

useTask(() => {
  // useTask will automatically invalidate the current
  // frame, so you don't have to do it manually.
})
```

Sometimes you may want to manually invalidate the current frame from within a
task. To do this, you can use the `invalidate` function from the
[`useThrelte`](/docs/reference/core/use-threlte) hook and set the `autoInvalidate`
option to `false`:

```ts
import { useTask, useThrelte } from '@threlte/core'

const { invalidate } = useThrelte()

useTask(
  () => {
    // Because `autoInvalidate` is set to `false`, the current
    // frame will not be invalidated automatically and you can
    // conditionally invalidate the current frame.
    invalidate()
  },
  { autoInvalidate: false }
)
```

## Mode `'manual'`

In the manual mode, you must manually trigger a re-render:

```ts
const { advance } = useThrelte()
advance()
```

This mode is useful when you want to have full control over when the scene is
rendered. For example, you may want to render the scene only when the user
interacts with the scene.

## Mode `'always'`

In the `'always'` mode, Threlte continuously renders the scene. This mode is the
easiest to use, but it is also the most resource intensive and should only be
used when necessary.

## Setting the Render Mode

### `<Canvas>` Prop

You can set the render mode by setting the property `renderMode` on the
[`<Canvas>`](/docs/reference/core/canvas) component:

```svelte
<Canvas renderMode="on-demand" />
```

### `useThrelte` Hook

You can also set the render mode from anywhere within your Threlte app using the
[`useThrelte`](/docs/reference/core/use-threlte) hook:

```ts
const { renderMode } = useThrelte()
renderMode.set('on-demand')
```

<Tip type="tip">
  The renderMode property can be changed at any time, but it will only take effect on the next
  frame.
</Tip>

## Render Modes and Custom Rendering

By default, Threlte will automatically render the scene for you. In some cases,
you may want to render the scene yourself, for example when using [post
processing](/docs/examples/postprocessing/outlines).

1. Set `autoRender` to `false` on the [`<Canvas>`](/docs/reference/core/canvas)
   component. This will prevent Threlte from automatically rendering the scene
   and you can render the scene yourself.

```svelte
<Canvas autoRender={false} />
```

2. Set up a task that renders the scene. There are two ways to do this:

- Add a task to [Threlte's default
  `renderStage`](/docs/learn/basics/scheduling-tasks#default-stages). Tasks in
  that stage will be executed after tasks in Threlte's `mainStage` and only
  when a re-render is necessary based on the current render mode. This is the
  recommended approach.

```ts
import { useTask, useThrelte } from '@threlte/core'

const { renderStage } = useThrelte()

useTask(
  () => {
    // render here
  },
  { stage: renderStage, autoInvalidate: false }
)
```

- Use `shouldRender` from the hook
  [`useThrelte`](/docs/reference/core/use-threlte). This function will evaluate
  to `true` based on the current render mode. This allows for more fine-grained
  control over when to render and is useful when you want to render in a task
  that is not in [Threlte's default
  `renderStage`](/docs/learn/basics/scheduling-tasks#default-stages).

```ts
import { useThrelte, useTask } from '@threlte/core'

const { shouldRender } = useThrelte()

useTask(
  () => {
    if (shouldRender()) {
      // render here
    }
  },
  { autoInvalidate: false }
)
```
