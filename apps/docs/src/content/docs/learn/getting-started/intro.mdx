Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.
Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.

```svelte title=App.svelte
<script>
  // your script goes here
  import * as THREE from 'three';
  import { T } from '@threlte/core';
  const x = 0;
</script>
<p> hello world </p>
{x}
<T.Mesh>
  <T.BoxGeometry/>
  <T.MeshStandardMaterial/>
</T.Mesh>
```
