To start using Threlte, you can either [scaffold a new project using the CLI](#scaffold-a-new-threlte-project) or install the packages [manually in an existing project](#manually-install-threlte-in-an-existing-project).

## Scaffold a new Threlte project

The easiest way to get started with Threlte is to use the command `npm create threlte` to scaffold a
new project. This CLI will interactively guide you through creating a new SvelteKit project as well
as installing and configuring Threlte and its dependencies.

```bash
npm create threlte my-project
```

## Manually install Threlte in an existing project

Threlte consists of 7 packages which can be installed and used individually. `@threlte/core` and Three.js
itself are required for all projects while the other packages are optional.
[`@threlte/gltf`](/docs/reference/gltf/getting-started) does not need to be installed separately as it
can be used with `npx`, the resulting Threlte components however require `@threlte/extras` to be installed.

### Choose the packages you want to use
