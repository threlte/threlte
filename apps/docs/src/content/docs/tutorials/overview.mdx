Your welcome to skip ahead to specific sections

The package `'@threlte/extras'` provides components, plugins, hooks and utilities. They are mostly abstractions on top of the `<T/>` component.

<CardGrid>
  <Card
    title="Shapes, Assets, Sound and Async"
    icon="pencil"
  >
    how to load/await models, textures, sounds, display text, insert DOM-like components and adjust
    the scene hirearchy.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Helpers, Visual guides and Controls"
    icon="add-document"
  >
    Components that create visual aids, change how the camera moves or enable objects to be moved
    around.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Visual Effects, Materials, Shaders and Post-Processing"
    icon="setting"
  >
    These components change how an object looks, getting effects not possible with standard meshes &
    lighting.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Transitions, Interactivity, Animation and Staging"
    icon="open-book"
  >
    Components to help setup the stage to show off particular objects as well as plugins to bring
    objects to life and make them user interactive.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Performance, Shadows and Rendering"
    icon="open-book"
