title: Scheduling Tasks
---

import Tip from '$components/Tip/Tip.astro'

In 3D apps and games, a lot of work is done in functions that run on every frame.
Web-based apps rely on the browser's `requestAnimationFrame` that runs a callback
function when a new frame is rendered. When encapsulating logic into smaller
parts (i.e. _components_), we often need to run multiple
callbacks that may be dependent on each other. For instance, we
may want to update the position of an object based on user input and then render
the scene with the updated position.

In Threlte, these functions are called **tasks** and may or may not follow a
specific order. If an order is specified, the respective task has a
**dependency** to other tasks and vice versa. Tasks are grouped into **stages**
and follow the same logic: They may or may not have dependencies to other stages
to be executed in a specific order. A Threlte app is managed by a single
**scheduler**.

In this section, we will learn how to use the easy-to-use tools that the
**Threlte Task Scheduling System** provides to create and orchestrate stages
and tasks.

## Scheduler

Every Threlte app has a single scheduler. It is accessible via [`useThrelte()`](/docs/reference/core/use-threlte):

```ts
const { scheduler } = useThrelte()
```

<Tip type="info">
  Usually you won't need to interact with the scheduler directly. It is used internally by Threlte.
  However, you can use it to create stages and run tasks manually for more advanced use cases.
</Tip>

## Stages

Stages are **groups of tasks**. They are executed in a specific order.

### Default Stages

By default, Threlte will create two stages for you:

- **`mainStage`**: This stage holds all the tasks that are not assigned to any
  other stage.
- **`renderStage`**: This stage will be executed after the `mainStage`. It is
  used to render the scene and only ever executes its tasks when a re-render is
  needed.

These two stages are created automatically and are accessible via
[`useThrelte()`](/docs/reference/core/use-threlte):

```ts
const { mainStage, renderStage } = useThrelte()
```

### Creating a Stage

Sometimes, you may want to create your own stage, for instance to run tasks
after rendering. You can do so by using the hook `useStage`. The hook will
create a stage if it does not exist yet, or return the existing stage if it
does.

```ts
const { renderStage } = useThrelte()

const afterRenderStage = useStage('after-render', {
  after: renderStage
})
```

All tasks added to the stage `afterRenderStage` will be executed after the tasks
of the stage `renderStage`.

<Tip type="tip">Be aware that `useStage` never removes a stage as that's usually not needed.</Tip>

A stage decides **when and how its tasks are executed**. By default, a stage will
execute its tasks on every frame. You can change this behavior by passing a
`callback` option to `useStage`. This callback will be called every frame. The
first argument `delta` is the time elapsed since the last frame. The second
argument `runTasks` is a function that when invoked will run all the tasks of
the stage in their respective order. You can use it to run the tasks only when
needed (e.g. when a condition is met) or to run them multiple times. If a number
is passed as the first argument to runTasks, the tasks will receive that as the
delta.

```ts
const { renderStage } = useThrelte()

const conditionalStage = useStage('after-render', {
  after: renderStage,
  callback: (delta, runTasks) => {
    // This callback will be called every frame. The first argument is the time elapsed
    // since the last frame. The second argument is a function that will run all the
    // tasks of the stage. You can use it to run the tasks only when needed (e.g. when
    // a condition is met) or to run them multiple times. If a number is passed as the
    // first argument to runTasks, the tasks will receive that as the delta.
    if (condition) {
      runTasks()
    }
  }
})
```

### Removing a Stage

You can remove a stage by calling the `remove` method of the scheduler. The first
argument is the stage or the key of the stage to remove.

```ts
const { scheduler } = useThrelte()

scheduler.removeStage(afterRenderStage)
```

<Tip>
  Be aware that removing a stage will also remove all the tasks in that stage. Usually, you won't
  need to remove a stage.
</Tip>

## Tasks

Tasks are functions that are executed on every frame. They are grouped in
stages. You can add a task to a stage by using the hook `useTask`. The hook will
create a task and add it to a stage.

### Default Tasks

By default, Threlte will create a single task for you:

- **`autoRenderTask`**: This task is part of [Threlte's
  `renderStage`](#default-stages) and will render the scene if
  [`autoRender`](/docs/reference/core/canvas) is set to `true`.

This task is created automatically and is accessible via
[`useThrelte()`](/docs/reference/core/use-threlte):

```ts
const { autoRenderTask } = useThrelte()
```

### Creating an Anonymous Task

In its most basic form, `useTask` takes a function as its first argument. This
function will be executed on every frame, starting on the next frame and
receives the delta time representing the time since the last frame as its first
argument. By default, the created task is added to [Threlte's
`mainStage`](#default-stages) in an arbitrary order (i.e. without dependencies).

```ts
const { start, stop, started, task } = useTask((delta) => {
  // This function will be executed on every frame
})
```

It returns an object with the following properties:

- `start`: A function that starts the task. It will be executed on the next
  frame. Note that by default a task is started automatically.
- `stop`: A function that stops the task. It will not be executed on the next
  frame.
- `started`: A boolean Svelte `Readable` store indicating whether the task is
  started or not.
- `task`: The task itself. You can use it to indicate a dependency to this task
  on another task.

### Creating a Keyed Task

You can _key_ a task by passing it as the first argument to `useTask`. This
makes referencing this task easier across your app. The key can be any `string`
or `symbol` value that is unique across all tasks in the stage it is added to.

```ts
const {
  start,
  stop,
  started,
  task: someTask
} = useTask('some-task', (delta) => {
  // This function will be executed on every frame
})
```

### Creating a Task in a Stage

You can also pass a stage that the task should be added to as an option to
`useTask`:

```ts
useTask(
  (delta) => {
    // This function will be executed on every frame as a
    // task in the stage `afterRenderStage`.
  },
  { stage: afterRenderStage }
)
```

### Task Dependencies

A common use case for tasks is to run code after another task has been executed. Imagine
a game where an object is transformed by user input in one task and a camera follows that
object in another task. The camera task should be executed after the object has been
transformed.

To control the order in which tasks are executed in a stage, you can pass a
`before` and `after` option to `useTask`. The tasks passed to these options are
called **dependencies** and can be a task itself, the key of a task or an array
of tasks or keys. The referenced tasks must be in the same stage as the task you
are creating.

Task dependencies **do not need to be created yet** if they are passed by key.
The declared dependencies will be taken into account when they are created later
on.

#### Examples

```ts
// Execute a task after a single task passed by reference
useTask(
  (delta) => {
    // …
  },
  { after: someTask }
)
```

```ts
// Execute a task after a single task passed by key
useTask(
  (delta) => {
    // …
  },
  { after: 'some-task' }
)
```

```ts
// Execute a task after multiple tasks passed by reference
useTask(
  (delta) => {
    // …
  },
  { after: [someTask, someOtherTask] }
)
```

```ts
// Execute a task after a certain task but before another one
useTask(
  (delta) => {
    // …
  },
  { after: someTask, before: someOtherTask }
)
```

```ts
// Reference a task as a dependency that hasn't been created yet
useTask(
  (delta) => {
    // If a task with the key `some-task` is created later on,
    // this task will be executed after it.
  },
  { before: 'some-task' }
)

useTask('some-task', (delta) => {
  // …
})
```

<Tip type="warning">
  If a task is passed by reference to the `before` or `after` option, the task created by `useTask`
  will automatically be added to the same stage as the task it depends on. If you pass a key instead
  and the task you want to reference is **not** in [Threlte's `mainStage`](#default-stages), you
  will also need to pass the stage, either by value or key.
</Tip>

## Reviewing the schedule

To debug the execution order, you can use the `getSchedule` method of the scheduler at any
time.

```ts
const { scheduler } = useThrelte()

scheduler.getSchedule({
  tasks: true
})
```

```json title="Result"
{
  "stages": [
    {
      "key": "physics stage",
      "tasks": ["physics"]
    },
    {
      "key": "main stage",
      "tasks": ["move object", "move camera"]
    },
    {
      "key": "render stage",
      "tasks": ["render"]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, the effective task execution order is:

1. `physics`
2. `move object`
3. `move camera`
4. `render`
