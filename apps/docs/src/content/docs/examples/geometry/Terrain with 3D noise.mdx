The key to creating "random" yet smooth terrain is using "noise".

To create a terrain map, we want to be able to input the x and y coordinate , and return a height value.
Therefore we want to utilise 2D noise, and this example uses the function `createNoise2D` from the package `simplex-noise`.

<Example path="geometry/terrain" />

### How is this done?

In Scene.svelte:

1. Create noise map

`const noise = createNoise2D()`

2. Create plane geometry

`const geometry = new PlaneGeometry(10, 10, 100, 100)`

<Tip type="tip">
Reminder that planes are on their side by default!

i.e. they extend in the x and y directions, and the z value of each vertex is 0

</Tip>

3. Extract the "position" (vertices) array from the PlaneGeometry

   `const geometry = geometry.getAttribute('position').array`

4. Loop over the vertices, setting each `z` value, using our noise map

```ts
for (let i = 0; i < vertices.length; i += 3) {
  const x = vertices[i]
  const y = vertices[i + 1]
  // @ts-ignore
  vertices[i + 2] = noise(x / 4, y / 4)
}
```

<Tip type="tip">
Why `i+=3`?

The position array is a **flat** array of vertices, in the recurring format "x y z x y z..."
So if we want to set each vertex's z value from it's x and y, we need to loop in triplets.

</Tip>

5. Attach the plane geometry to a mesh, and rotate

```svelte
<T.Mesh
	{geometry}
	rotation.x={DEG2RAD * -90}
>
```

<Tip type="tip">
This example intentionally used only part of the noise map (the middle 25%), in order to generate gentler terrain.

To "see" the noise map in full, change `noise(x/4, y/4)` to `noise(x, y)`.

You'll see that the terrain is much more hilly!

</Tip>
