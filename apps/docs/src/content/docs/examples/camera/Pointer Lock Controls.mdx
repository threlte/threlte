title: Pointer Lock Controls

import Example from '$components/Example/Example.astro'

A remix of threejs' [PointerLockControls](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/PointerLockControls). It uses the [Pointer Lock API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API).

### Use-case

Controlling the camera in a 1st-person video game.

- click the scene to lock the pointer to the scene
- press 'Esc' to release pointer

<Example path="camera/pointer-lock-controls" />

### Explanation

When the scene is clicked, the pointer is locked to the scene, and now pointer movements will control the angle of the camera in the scene.

1. there is no need to click and drag, like with e.g. `OrbitControls`.
2. > Pointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen

To explain the 2nd point, find a Threlte scene which uses `OrbitControls` for it's camera. Now click and drag the cursor left until you hit the edge of your screen.
When you hit the edge, the camera will stop rotating. But in a video game, we want to be able to for example, turn to spin clockwise as many times as we like. Hence why we need to lock the pointer.

This pointer locking behaviour is performed by basically any native video game when it is run on a computer.
