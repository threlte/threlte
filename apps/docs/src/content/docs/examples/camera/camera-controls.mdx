You may have come up against limitations with `<OrbitalControls/>` from three.js. [Camera Controls](https://github.com/yomotsu/camera-controls) is an existing project which supports smooth transitions and has many more features.

The example below has a component with a basic implementation of camera-controls and functions equivelant to this [camera-controls doc example](https://yomotsu.github.io/camera-controls/examples/basic.html). Your project may need specific features in which case, [visit their docs](https://github.com/yomotsu/camera-controls) and adjust the component to suit.

:::note
The camera-controls package features include first-person, third-person, pointer-lock,
fit-to-bounding-sphere and much more!
