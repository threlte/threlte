title: Scope with Zoom

import Example from '$components/Example/Example.astro'

This example shows how to utilize useFBO hook to create a sniper scope zoom effect, complete
with lens distortion and crosshairs.

<Example path="shaders/useFboScope" />

## How does it work?

The hook is used to render a scene onto a texture, using
it in a shader. The [WebGLRenderTarget](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/renderers/WebGLRenderTarget) texture
from [useFBO](/reference/extras/misc/use-fbo) hook is used in the scope where a
vignette and lens distortion effects are applied and a reticle is added.

### Scene setup

The scene is constructed using two free models sourced from Sketchfab:
a piece of terrain and a scope model. These models are converted into Svelte components using the
[Threlte gltf CLI tool](/reference/gltf/getting-started) tool.

The scope model is attached directly to the `<PerspectiveCamera>` so that both move in sync with
the user's mouse movements. A circular mesh is positioned as a child of the scope and serves as an eyepiece -
this is where the custom ShaderMaterial is used for simulating the view through the scope.

Control over the scope - activation, movement and pointer-lock toggling â€” is managed within a `Controls.svelte` file.

### Rendering the scene to a texture

The [useFBO](/reference/extras/misc/use-fbo) hook is used to prepare a render target for the scope's view texture.
Given that the scope's viewport occupies only a fraction of the full screen,
the texture's resolution is appropriately downscaled to conserve resources.

A `useTask` hook is used to render the scene onto this target:

```ts
const renderTarget = useFBO($size.width * 0.5, $size.height * 0.5, {
	samples: 8
})

let scope: Group

useTask(() => {
	if (!scope || !$scoping) return
	const cam = $camera as PerspectiveCamera

	scope.visible = false
	cam.fov = $zoomedFov
	cam.updateProjectionMatrix()
	cam.matrixWorldNeedsUpdate = true
	renderer.setRenderTarget(renderTarget)
	renderer.render(scene, cam)

	renderer.setRenderTarget(null)
	cam.fov = baseFov
	cam.updateProjectionMatrix()
	scope.visible = true
})
```

Here's what happens step by step:

1. The scope's visibility is set to `false` to prevent it from appearing in the texture capture.
2. The camera's field of view (`fov`) is adjusted, and its projection matrix is updated to apply current zoom level.
3. The renderer's target is switched to the one created by the useFBO hook.
4. The scene is rendered from the perspective of the adjusted camera.
5. The renderer's target is reset to `null` for rendering to the screen again, and the camera's FOV is restored to its
   original setting, with the scope becoming visible again.

### Scope shader

The shader for the scope's view employs two textures: the rendered scene texture and a reticle image.

Inside the shader:

- **UV adjustment**: To accommodate different screen sizes and the circular shape of the scope, UV coordinates are adjusted for proper mapping of the view texture onto the scope.
- **Cubic lens distortion**: The scene texture is distorted using a cubic lens effect to simulate the optical characteristics of a real scope.
- **Vignetting**: A vignette effect is applied to the distorted scene texture, darkening the edges around the scope.
- **Crosshair overlay**: The reticle texture is blended with the modified scene texture, adding the crosshair overlay to the scope's view.
