This example demonstrates [`<InstancedSprites>`](/reference/extras/performance/instanced-sprite), showing
a few different approaches for instancing and updating large numbers of sprites in your scene.

<Example path="instancing/instanced-sprite-mania" />

## How it works?

This covers step-by-step how you can configure `<InstancedSprite/>` component, starting from defining a spritesheet, then adding it to the scene and finally updating the instances in real time.

### Sprite metadata object

```svelte title=Flyer.svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { InstancedSprite, buildSpritesheet } from '@threlte/extras'
  import UpdaterFlying from './UpdaterFlying.svelte'
  import type { SpritesheetMetadata } from '@threlte/extras'

  const demonSpriteMeta = [
    {
      url: '/textures/sprites/cacodaemon.png',
      type: 'rowColumn',
      width: 8,
      height: 4,
      animations: [
        { name: 'fly', frameRange: [0, 5] },
        { name: 'attack', frameRange: [8, 13] },
        { name: 'idle', frameRange: [16, 19] },
        { name: 'death', frameRange: [24, 31] }
      ]
    }
  ] as const satisfies SpritesheetMetadata

  const flyerSheetbuilder = buildSpritesheet.from<typeof demonSpriteMeta>(demonSpriteMeta)
</script>
```

In this example, there is a single sprite image containing 4 different animations. The metadata is contained within the
`demonSpriteMeta` object, which describes the layout and animation details of the spritesheet.

In this case, the spritesheet image is arranged in a grid of 4 rows and 8 columns, so the `type` is set to `'rowColumn'`,
`height` to `4` (indicating the number of rows), and `width` to `8` (representing the number of columns).
The `animations` property is an array, where each element represents a separate animation with a `name` and a `frameRange`.

For detailed information on defining animations and using frame ranges, refer to the [Spritesheet builder section](/reference/extras/performance/instanced-sprite#spritesheetmetadata)

### Adding component to the scene

```svelte title=Flyer.svelte
{#await flyerSheetbuilder.spritesheet then spritesheet}
  <InstancedSprite
    count={20000}
    {spritesheet}
  >
    <!-- User component for updating instances -->
    <UpdaterFlying /> /
    <!-- -->
  </InstancedSprite>
{/await}
```

We add `<InstancedSprite>` to the scene with a `count` `spritesheet` - the only required props. Spritesheet is a result of the promise from the previous step.

To add the `<InstancedSprite>` component to the scene, you need to specify at least two essential properties:
`count` and `spritesheet`. The `spritesheet` property is the object obtained as the result of awaiting the Promise of the `buildSpritesheet` function called earlier.

### Updating instances

In our example, the user made `<FlyingBehaviour>` component is responsible for updating sprites.
This component leverages the `useInstancedSprite()` hook, which makes it easy to access and
adjust sprite properties such as position and animation.

To update sprite instances, we utilize the `useTask` hook. Inside, a loop iterates over the IDs
of all instances, applying updates to their positions and assigning the fly animation to each.
This description is simplified for brevity, this is where you'd have your complex movement or game logic.
A working example, demonstrating basic random movement, is available in the source of the live example for this component
(UpdaterFlying.svelte, UpdaterWalking.svelte, UpdaterFlyingHook.svelte).

```svelte title=FlyingBehaviour.svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { useTask } from '@threlte/core'
  import { useInstancedSprite } from '@threlte/extras'

  const { updatePosition, count, animationMap, sprite } = useInstancedSprite()

  useTask(() => {
    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
      updatePosition(i, [0, 0, 0])
      sprite.animation.setAt(i, 'fly')
    }
  })
</script>
```

## Instancing approaches

This section goes over each component used in the scene and provides a short explanation of different approaches used with `<InstancedSprite/>` component.
Every component is designed differently, aimed to present varied approaches to updating instance properties, loading and defining spritesheets.

### From json

`DudeSprites.svelte` adds sprites with random walk to the scene. One of them is controlled by the player with the use of `WASD` keys.
This example uses an untyped `useInstancedSprite()` hook within the `WalkingBehaviour.svelte` component to update the sprites.

### One file, many animations

`FlyerSprites.svelte` is the sprite from the first section where we went over step by step how to work with the component.
Here, the spritesheet is constructed using the `buildSpritesheet.from` utility, defining multiple animations within a single sprite file.

Although this setup does not initially add TypeScript autocompletion of animation names, an alternative version found in
`FlyerSpritesTyped.svelte` addresses this.

### Multiple files, one animation per

`GoblinSprites.svelte` builds a spritesheet from multiple files, each of them containing a single animation. Similar to the
flyers, this example uses the `buildSpritesheet.from` utility.
Instances remain stationary but frequently change their animation. Direct updates to the animation are made through the `InstancedSpriteMesh`,
accessed via a `ref` binding.

### Static

The example in `TreeSpriteAtlas.svelte` demonstrates the setup of static sprites, as outlined in [Static sprites & Atlassing](/reference/extras/performance/instanced-sprite#static-sprites--atlassing).

Each frame is named and used as a different tree sprite, selected at random. Then, the playmode is set to "PAUSE," and auto-updates are disabled,
ensuring that each sprite remains fixed. In this case, the `<Instance/>` component is used for setting positions and frames.
