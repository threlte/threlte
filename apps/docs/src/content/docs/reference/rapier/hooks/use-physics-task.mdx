type: 'hook'

This hook acts just like the `useTask` hook, but automatically adds the handler
to the `simulation` stage and always runs _before_ the `simulationTask`, so
before the physics world is stepped.

Depending on your [choice of framerate](/reference/rapier/framerate) the
provided callback will be called differently:

### Varying Framerate

When you're using a varying framerate for your physics simulation, the hook
essentially behaves like a regular `useTask` with the benefit that it's added to
the physics stage automatically and is guaranteed to run _before_ the physics
world is stepped.

```svelte
<World framerate="varying">
```

```ts
usePhysicsTask((delta) => {
  console.log(delta) // ~0.016
})
```

### Fixed Framerate

When you're using a fixed framerate for your physics simulation, the callback
will be called with the fixed delta time between frames.

```svelte
<World framerate={200}>
```

```ts
usePhysicsTask((delta) => {
  console.log(delta) // 0.005
})
```
