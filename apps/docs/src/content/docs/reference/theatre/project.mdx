Theatre.js work is organized into projects that group animation [\<Sheet\>](./sheet)s.

Projects also provide the means to inject configuration state exported as a JSON file from the [\<Studio\>](./studio) back into your code through a prop: `<Project config={{ state }}>`.

While multiple projects may be created, one is usually sufficient for a whole Threlte application.

### Creating a Project

```svelte
<script>
  import { Project, Sheet, SheetObject } from '@threlte/theatre'
</script>

<!-- Will create a project with the name "Project A" -->
<Project name="Project A">
  <Sheet name="Sheet A">
    <SheetObject key="ObjectA" />
  </Sheet>
</Project>
```

### Loading a Saved State

The state of a project edited in the [\<Studio\>](./studio) is saved in your browser's local storage, and can be [exported from within the studio interface](https://www.theatrejs.com/docs/latest/manual/projects#state). It's a JSON file containing all animated and static properties of all sheets of the project.

```svelte
<script>
  import { Project, Sheet, SheetObject } from '@threlte/theatre'
  import state from './state.json'
</script>

<!--
	Will create a project with the name "Project A",
	load its state and mount all children when
	finished loading
-->
<Project
  config={{ state }}
  name="Project A"
>
  <Sheet
    name="Sheet A"
    autoplay
  >
    <SheetObject key="ObjectA" />
  </Sheet>
</Project>
```
