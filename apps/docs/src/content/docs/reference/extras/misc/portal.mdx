import Example from '$components/Example/Example.astro'

A component that renders its children as children of an object that can exist **anywhere in your Threlte application**.
You can either provide an object that will be the parent of the children or use the prop `id` to render into a `<PortalTarget>`.

:::tip
Although Portals are extremely helpful in certain situations, it can be hard to reason about them
at times. It's recommended to use them sparingly.

## Examples

### Render Helper Objects

Some objects such as the [`THREE.DirectionalLightHelper`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/helpers/DirectionalLightHelper)
need to be added to the scene instead of the light itself or another parent to be functional. We can use the `<Portal>` component for that.

### Render to a `<PortalTarget>`

You can define where a `<Portal>` should render its children by using the component [`<PortalTarget>`](/reference/extras/misc/portal-target).
