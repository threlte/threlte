The hook `useSuspense` is used to mark a resource as being used in a
`<Suspense>` boundary or to get the `suspended`-state of the closest
`<Suspense>` boundary. For a complete implementation example, have a look at the
[`<Suspense>` component](/reference/extras/suspense).

## Usage

### Suspend an Async Resource

The hook returns a function that allows you to mark a resource as being used in
a `<Suspense>` boundary. To suspend the closest `<Suspense>` boundary, call the
function returned by `useSuspense()` and pass a promise as the first argument.
Because [`useLoader().load()`](/reference/core/hooks/use-loader) returns an
[`AsyncWritable`](/reference/core/utilities#asyncwritable), the result of
`useLoader().load()` can be passed directly to the function returned by
`useSuspense()`.

```svelte
<script>
  const suspend = useSuspense()

  const promise = suspend(useTexture('/texture.png'))
</script>
```

### Get Suspended State

The hook can be used to get the `suspended`-state of the closest `<Suspense>` boundary.

```svelte
<script>
  const { suspended } = useSuspense()

  $inspect($suspended)
</script>
```
