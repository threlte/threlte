`onSuspend` invokes a callback when the component becomes suspended
within the boundaries of a [`<Suspense>`](/reference/extras/loading/suspense) component. If there is no `<Suspense>`
component, the callback will never be executed, as the component will never
suspend.

## Example

The following component loads a model with the hook `useGltf` and is potentially
wrapped in a `<Suspense>` boundary.

```svelte
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { onSuspend, useGltf } from '@threlte/extras'

  const gltf = useGltf('model.gltf')

  onSuspend(() => {
    console.log('The component has been suspended')
  })
</script>

{#await gltf then { scene }}
  <T is={scene}>
{/await}
```

:::tip
`onSuspend` can be used to execute additional logic
when a component becomes suspended within a `<Suspense>` boundary.
