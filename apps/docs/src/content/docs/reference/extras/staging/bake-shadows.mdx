`<BakeShadows>` instantly freezes all shadow maps upon mounting and unfreezes them upon unmounting. This improves performance by making all shadows static. Use `<BakeShadows` if you have a complex but static scene as the shadows will only be calculated once.

<Example path="extras/bake-shadows/basic" />

When `<BakeShadows>` is used within a `<Suspense>`, shadows will be frozen after the boundary is no longer in a suspended state. It will unfreeze if the boundary is re-suspended.

<Example path="extras/bake-shadows/spaceships" />

The example above is an ideal scene for `<BakeShadows>` because all objects are stationary and the shadows will never change.
