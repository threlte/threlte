`<Detailed>` is an abstraction around ThreeJS's [LOD](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/LOD). A common technique to improve performance is to swap out high-detail models or meshes for low-detail ones at large distances.

<Example path="extras/detailed" />

Notice how as the mesh's distance from the camera increases, a geometry with less vertices is shown.

<Tip type="warning">
The distance between the camera and the `<Detailed>` component itself is what determines which level-of-detail to use. You can set positions for children but they will not be used in the distance calculation.
</Tip>

Children of `<Detailed>` accept a distance prop. This prop determines the visibility of each child based on its distance from the camera. If not specified, distance defaults to 0.

```svelte
<Detailed>
  <T.Mesh>
    <T.BoxGeometry />
  </T.Mesh>
  <T.Mesh distance={10}>
    <T.BoxGeometry />
  </T.Mesh>
</Detailed>
```

Children of `<Detailed>` accept a hysteresis prop which can be used to prevent flickering at LOD boundaries. If not specified, hysteresis defaults to 0.

```svelte
<Detailed>
  <T.Mesh hysteresis={0.5}>
    <T.BoxGeometry />
  </T.Mesh>
</Detailed>
```

<Tip type="tip">
  It is fairly common to export a high-detail, medium-detail, and low-detail model from 3D asset
  creation tools.
