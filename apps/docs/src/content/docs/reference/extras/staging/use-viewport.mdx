import Example from '$components/Example/Example.astro'

The `useViewport` hook returns a `viewport` which provides information related to the screen.

<Example path="extras/use-viewport" />

The `width` and `height` properties provide the screen size in Three.js units. For example, the following mesh would fill the entire screen:

```svelte
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { useViewport } from '@threlte/extras'

  const viewport = useViewport() // currentWritable<Viewport>
</script>

<T.Mesh scale={[$viewport.width, $viewport.height, 1]}>
  <T.PlaneGeometry />
  <T.MeshStandardMaterial />
</T.Mesh>
```

The `factor` property is the canvas width divided by the viewport width.

The `distance` property is the camera distance from an origin point. The default origin is `0,0,0`, but
a custom origin can be passed into the hook.

```ts
const viewport = useViewport([1, 0, 1])
```
