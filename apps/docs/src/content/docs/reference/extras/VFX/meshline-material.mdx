import Example from '$components/Example/Example.astro'

Used in combination with [`<MeshLineGeometry>`](/reference/extras/vfx/meshline-geometry) to create a line formed of a strip of billboarded triangles, based on <a href="https://github.com/spite/THREE.MeshLine" target="_blank">THREE.MeshLine</a>.

<Example path="extras/meshline-material/animated" />

## Usage

This component works by taking a line geometry from `<MeshLineGeometry>` and projecting and expanding the vertices in screen space.
Both `<MeshLineMaterial>` and `<MeshLineGeometry>` need belong to the same parent mesh.

### Example

```svelte
<script>
  const points = [new Vector3(-5, 1, 0), new Vector3(0, 1, 0), new Vector3(5, 1, 0)]
</script>

<T.Mesh>
  <MeshLineGeometry {points} />
  <MeshLineMaterial
    width={0.5}
    color="#fe3d00"
  />
</T.Mesh>
```

### Width and color

By default the line will be white and have a width of 1.
The `width` property will use world units and scale correctly with other objects in your scene.
If you would like the line to be a fixed size regardless of distance from the camera you can set the `attenuate` property to `false`.

### Opacity and dashes

Just like other materials in Three.js you need to set `transparent` to `true` for opacity to have any effect.
You must also set `transparent` to `true` for if you are using dashed lines.

You can use a combination of `dashArray`, `dashRatio` and `dashOffset` to create dashed lines.

:::tip
If you're rendering transparent lines, dashed lines or lines with an alpha map you can avoid
issues where the line overlaps itself by setting <b>depthTest</b> to <b>false</b>.

:::

### Alpha map

You can pass a texture to the `alphaMap` property to use as an alpha mask along the length of the line, where black is invisible and white is visible.
In the example below we load a paint brush texture with the `useTexture` hook.
