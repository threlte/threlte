The package `@threlte/xr` provides tools and abstractions to more easily create VR and AR experiences.

## Installation

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install @threlte/xr
```

## Usage

<Tip type="experimental">
  `@threlte/xr` is in beta. Major API changes at this point are not expected, but some breaking
  changes may occur before it reaches 1.0.0.
</Tip>

### Setup

The following adds a button to start your session and controllers inside an XR manager to prepare your scene for WebXR rendering and interaction.

```svelte title="Scene.svelte" {3,11}+
<script>
  import { Canvas } from '@threlte/core'
  import { VRButton } from '@threlte/xr'
  import Scene from './scene.svelte'
</script>

<Canvas>
  <Scene />
</Canvas>
<VRButton />
```

Then, in `scene.svelte`:

```svelte
<script>
  import { XR, Controller, Hand } from '@threlte/xr'
</script>

<XR />
<Controller left />
<Controller right />
<Hand left />
<Hand right />
```

This will set up your project to be able to enter a VR session with controllers and hand inputs added.

If you want hands, controllers, or any other objects to be added to your `THREE.Scene` only when the XR session starts, make them children of the `<XR>` component:

```svelte
<script>
  import { XR, Controller, Hand } from '@threlte/xr'
</script>

<XR>
  <Controller left />
  <Controller right />
  <Hand left />
  <Hand right />
</XR>
```

The `<XR>`, `<Controller>`, and `<Hand>` components can provide a powerful foundation when composed with other Threlte components.

For example, it doesn't take much more to get to the point of a simple BeatSaber-inspired experience:

<Example path="xr/bonksaber" />
