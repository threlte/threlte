import Example from '$components/Example/Example.astro'

Provides a reference to a requested hand joint, once available.

```svelte
<script>
  import { useHandJoint } from '@threlte/xr'

  const wristJoint = useHandJoint('left', 'wrist')
</script>
```

Reading hand joint positions in real time can be very useful, for example in providing rigid bodies for hands:

<Example path="xr/use-hand-joint" />
