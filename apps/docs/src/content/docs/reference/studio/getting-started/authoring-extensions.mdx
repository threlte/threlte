_All_ Studio functionality is provided by **Studio Extensions**. To make the
Studio suit your workflow, you may add your own Studio Extensions which may add
toolbar items, custom panes, have access to the scene and may access the state
of other extensions and run their actions.

:::caution
While it's technically possible to access and extend the Studio from anywhere within your app,
it's highly recommended to follow this pattern to easily remove the Studio **including all
extensions** from your app in production.
:::

## Example

Let's create a simple extension that increments and decrements a counter.

### Extension Directory Structure

In its simplest form, an extension consists of a single Svelte file. If you're
using TypeScript, you can define the types for the extension state and actions
in a separate file. Additionally, you can create a hook to interact with the
extension from outside and define the public API.

```plaintext
extensions/
  my-extension/
    MyExtension.svelte
    (types.ts)
    (useMyExtension.ts)
```

### (Optional) Type Definitions

This file provides type definitions for the extension state and actions.

```ts title="types.ts"
export const extensionScope = 'my-extension'

export type ExtensionState = {
	enabled: boolean
	count: number
}

export type ExtensionActions = {
	setEnabled: (enabled: boolean) => void
	toggleEnabled: () => void
	increment: () => void
	decrement: () => void
}
```

### Svelte Extension File

This file implements the extension. Furthermore, it has full access to the Threlte app.

```svelte title="MyExtension.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  import {
    useStudio,
    ToolbarItem,
    HorizontalButtonGroup,
    ToolbarButton
  } from '@threlte/studio/extend'
  import { extensionScope, type ExtensionState, type ExtensionActions } from './types'

  const { createExtension } = useStudio()

  createExtension<ExtensionState, ExtensionActions>({
    scope: extensionScope,
    state({ persist }) {
      return {
        enabled: persist(true),
        count: persist(0)
      }
    },
    actions: {
      toggleEnabled({ state }) {
        state.enabled = !state.enabled
      },
      setEnabled({ state }, enabled) {
        state.enabled = enabled
      },
      increment({ state }) {
        state.count++
      },
      decrement({ state }) {
        state.count--
      }
    },
    keyMap({ shift }) {
      return {
        increment: shift('+'),
        decrement: shift('-')
      }
    }
  })
</script>

<!-- Extension UI -->
<ToolbarItem position="left">
  <HorizontalButtonGroup>
    <ToolbarButton
      label="Decrement"
      icon="mdiMinus"
      on:click={extension.decrement}
      tooltip="Decrement (-)"
    />
    <ToolbarButton
      label="Increment"
      icon="mdiPlus"
      on:click={extension.increment}
      tooltip="Increment (+)"
    />
  </HorizontalButtonGroup>
</ToolbarItem>

<slot />
```

:::caution
Extensions must include a slot element to render the scene.:::

Let's look at creating the extension step by step:

1. Every extension is created using the `createExtension` function. If you're
   using TypeScript, you should provide the types for the extension state and
   actions.

```ts
createExtension<ExtensionState, ExtensionActions>({
```

2. An extension is registered with a unique scope (i.e. a string). This scope is
   used to identify the extensions state and actions.

```ts
  scope: extensionScope,
```

3. The `state` function is used to define the initial state of the extension.
   The `persist` function is used to automatically persist the state of the
   extension across sessions.

```ts
  state({ persist }) {
    return {
      enabled: persist(true),
      count: persist(0)
    }
  },
```

4. To mutate the state of the extension, you must define actions. Actions are
   functions that receive the extension state and can mutate it.

```ts
  actions: {
    toggleEnabled({ state }) {
      state.enabled = !state.enabled
    },
    setEnabled({ state }, enabled) {
      state.enabled = enabled
    },
    increment({ state }) {
      state.count++
    },
    decrement({ state }) {
      state.count--
    }
  },
```

5. You can define key mappings for the extension. Key mappings are used to
   trigger actions when a key combination is pressed. Key modifiers (`shift`,
   `alt`, `ctrl`, `meta`) are provided as arguments to the `keyMap` function,
   and they can be combined. The key mappings are defined as an object where the
   keys are the action names and the values are the key combinations.

```ts
  keyMap({ shift }) {
    return {
      increment: shift('+')
      decrement: shift('-')
    }
  }
```

### (Optional) Hook

This file exposes a hook to interact with the extension. It should be the only
way to interact with the extension and defines the public API that can be used
by other extensions.

```ts title="useMyExtension.ts"
import { useStudio } from '@threlte/studio/extend'
import { extensionScope, type ExtensionState, type ExtensionActions } from './types'

export const useMyExtension = () => {
	const { useExtension } = useStudio()

	const extension = useExtension<ExtensionState, ExtensionActions>(extensionScope)

	return {
		get enabled() {
			return extension.state.enabled
		},
		get count() {
			return extension.state.count
		},
		setEnabled: extension.setEnabled,
		toggleEnabled: extension.toggleEnabled,
		increment: extension.increment,
		decrement: extension.decrement
	}
}
```

### Usage

Adding the extension to the Studio is as simple as importing the extension file
and passing it to the `Studio` component.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Canvas } from '@threlte/core'
  import { Studio } from '@threlte/studio'
  import MyExtension from './MyExtension.svelte'
</script>

<Canvas>
  <Studio extensions={[MyExtension]}>
    <Scene />
  </Studio>
</Canvas>
```
