## Common Pattern

Typically you would want to remove the Studio from your app in production. This
can be done by wrapping the Studio component in a conditional statement that
checks if the app is in development mode:

```svelte title=App.svelte
<script>
  import { Canvas } from '@threlte/core'
  import Scene from './Scene.svelte'
</script>

<Canvas>
  {#if import.meta.env.MODE === 'development'}
    {#await import('@threlte/studio') then { Studio }}
      <Studio>
        <Scene />
      </Studio>
    {/await}
  {:else}
    <Scene />
  {/if}
</Canvas>
```

This way, the Studio will only be included in your app when it is in
[development mode](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#modes).

### Vite Plugin

The Threlte Studio vite plugin is only enabled in development mode.
