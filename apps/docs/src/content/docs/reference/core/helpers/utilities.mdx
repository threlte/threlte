Threlte comes with a few utilities that are catered towards the use in a Threlte application but can also be used in other projects.

## `watch`

Watch a single store or multiple stores and call a callback when they change to trigger side effects. The callback will be called immediately with the current value of the store.

```ts
const store = writable(0)
watch(store, (value) => {
	console.log(value) // 0
})
```

:::note
This utility function needs to be called during component initialization.
:::

You can also watch multiple stores:

```ts
const store1 = writable(0)
const store2 = writable(1)
watch([store1, store2], ([value1, value2]) => {
	console.log(value1, value2) // 0 1
})
```

The callback can return a cleanup function that will be called when the stores change again.

```ts
const store = writable(0)
watch(store, (value) => {
	console.log(value) // 0
	return () => {
		console.log('cleanup')
	}
})
```

## `memoize`

Use a single store or multiple stores and return the value(s) as an object.
This is useful for using stores in a non-reactive way e.g. in loops.

```ts
const numberStore = writable(0)
const memoized = memoize(numberStore) // { current: 0 }

useTask(() => {
	numberStore.update((n) => n + 1)
	console.log(memoized.current) // 1, 2, 3, ...
})

const stringStore = writable('hello')
const memoized = memoize([numberStore, stringStore])
console.log(memoized.current) // [0, 'hello']
```

:::note
This utility function needs to be called during component initialization.
:::

You can also pass a transform function to transform the values:

```ts
const store = writable(0)
const doubled = memoize(store, (n) => n * 2) // { current: 0 }

useTask(() => {
	store.update((n) => n + 1)
	console.log(doubled.current) // 2, 4, 6, ...
})
```

## `asyncWritable`

Creates a writable store that is initialized with a promise. The store also directly
implements the `then` and `catch` methods of the promise so that it can be
used in `await` expressions and `{#await}` blocks of Svelte.

```svelte
<script>
  import { asyncWritable } from '@threlte/core'

  const asyncOperation = async () => {
    // Do something async
  }
  const store = asyncWritable(asyncOperation())
  $: console.log($store) // asyncOperation result
</script>

<h1>
  {#await store then data}
    // Do something with the data
  {/await}
</h1>
```

This type of store is the return type of the [`load` function of `useLoader`](/reference/core/hooks/use-loader#loading-an-asset).

If an error occurs in the promise, the error will be logged to the console
and the error can be accessed via the `error` property of the store which is also a store.

```svelte
<script>
  import { asyncWritable } from '@threlte/core'

  const asyncOp = async () => {
    throw new Error('Something went wrong')
  }

  const store = asyncWritable(asyncOp())
  const error = store.error

  $: console.log($store) // undefined
  $: console.log($error) // Error: Something went wrong
</script>
```

## `currentWritable`

A writable store that also has a `current` property that is updated synchronously.
For use in non-reactive contexts e.g. loops where unwrapping a store every frame
(with Svelte's `get` method) is expensive.

```ts
const store = currentWritable(0)

useTask(() => {
	console.log(store.current) // 0
})
```
