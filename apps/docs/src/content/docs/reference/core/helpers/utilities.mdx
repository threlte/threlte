Threlte comes with a few utilities that are catered towards the use in a Threlte
application but can also be used in other projects.

## `watch`

Watch a single store or multiple stores and call a callback when they change to
trigger side effects. The callback will be called immediately with the current
value of the store.

```ts
const store = writable(0)

watch(store, (value) => {
  console.log(value) // 0
})
```

:::note
This utility function needs to be called during component initialization.
:::

You can also watch multiple stores:

```ts
const store1 = writable(0)
const store2 = writable(1)

watch([store1, store2], ([value1, value2]) => {
  console.log(value1, value2) // 0 1
})
```

The callback can return a cleanup function that will be called when the stores change again.

```ts
const store = writable(0)

watch(store, (value) => {
  console.log(value) // 0
  return () => {
    console.log('cleanup')
  }
})
```

## `observe`

Watch a single or multiple reactive values or stores and call a callback when
they change. This is the runes-equivalent to [`watch`](#watch) and supports both
stores and reactive values. It does however serve a different purpose: As
opposed to `watch`, the provided callback is not called synchronously when
stores or reactive values change but in the next microtask. This utility uses
[Svelte's `$effect`](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$effect) under the hood.

```ts
let count = $state(0)
let name = $state('John')
const iteration = writable(0)

observe(
  () => [count, iteration],
  ([count, iteration]) => {
    // This callback is only called when `count` or `iteration` changes
    // and not when `name` changes.
    console.log(count, iteration, name)
  }
)
```

## `observe.pre`

This is the same as [`observe`](#observe) but it uses
[`$effect.pre`](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$effect#$effect.pre) instead of
`$effect`.

## `asyncWritable`

Creates a writable store that is initialized with a promise. The store also directly
implements the `then` and `catch` methods of the promise so that it can be
used in `await` expressions and `{#await}` blocks of Svelte.

```svelte
<script>
  import { asyncWritable } from '@threlte/core'

  const asyncOperation = async () => {
    // Do something async
  }
  const store = asyncWritable(asyncOperation())
  $: console.log($store) // asyncOperation result
</script>

<h1>
  {#await store then data}
    // Do something with the data
  {/await}
</h1>
```

This type of store is the return type of the [`load` function of `useLoader`](/reference/core/hooks/use-loader#loading-an-asset).

If an error occurs in the promise, the error will be logged to the console
and the error can be accessed via the `error` property of the store which is also a store.

```svelte
<script>
  import { asyncWritable } from '@threlte/core'

  const asyncOp = async () => {
    throw new Error('Something went wrong')
  }

  const store = asyncWritable(asyncOp())
  const error = store.error

  $: console.log($store) // undefined
  $: console.log($error) // Error: Something went wrong
</script>
```

## `currentWritable`

A writable store that also has a `current` property that is updated synchronously.
For use in non-reactive contexts e.g. loops where unwrapping a store every frame
(with Svelte's `get` method) is expensive.

```ts
const store = currentWritable(0)

useTask(() => {
  console.log(store.current) // 0
})
```

## `isInstanceOf`

Check if an object is an instance of a given THREE class. This function can be
used as a type guard and as an alternative to
[`instanceof`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/instanceof)
which is prone to error and [slower](https://jsperf.app/jazula). This function
uses the `isFoo` property that THREE classes have to determine if an object is
of a particular class.

```ts
const obj = new Object3D()

// Later, in an unknown context
if (isInstanceOf(obj, 'Object3D')) {
  obj.position.x = 5
}
```
