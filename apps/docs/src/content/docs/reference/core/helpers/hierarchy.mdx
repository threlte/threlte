:::caution
This component is mostly used internally and is not required for most use cases.
:::

To control adding and removing components from the scene graph there's the following component:

- [`<HierarchicalObject>`](/reference/core/hierarchical-object)

A simple extension of the `<HierarchicalObject>` is the [`<SceneGraphObject>`](/reference/core/scene-graph-object).

For most other use cases the [`<Portal>`](/reference/extras/misc/portal) component is what your looking for.
