A typical Threlte application will make use of textures, models, and other assets. These assets are loaded using the `useLoader` hook. Assets loaded via `useLoader` are automatically cached and will not be loaded or parsed again if they are already in the cache.

<Tip type="info">
  This section assumes you placed your assets in your public folder or in a place in your
  application where you can import them easily.
</Tip>

## Loading Models

Models of different 3D model extensions can be loaded with their respective loaders. For this guide, we're going to use the `GLTFLoader` to load a `.gltf` model. In this section we're also going to discuss a few things that are specific to **loading and caching models**.

We start off by importing the `GLTFLoader` and `useLoader` hook:

```ts
import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader.js'
import { useLoader } from '@threlte/core'
```

Then we can use the `useLoader` hook to load our model:

```ts
const gltf = useLoader(GLTFLoader).load('/assets/model.gltf')
```

Again, the type of `gltf` is an `AsyncWritable` custom store. Its value will be `undefined` until the model has loaded. To use this model, we can use a conditional:

```svelte
{#if $gltf}
  <T is={$gltf.scene} />
{/if}
```

### Reusing Models

We included the `<T>` component here to add the model to our Threlte application but immediately two problems arise:

- The contents of the model are opaque to us.
  At the code level we don't know what the model contains and we can't access it.
- The model is cached. If we load the same model again, we won't get a new model but the same model
  we already loaded and we can't place it in our scene again at a different location.

To fix this, we'll use Threlte's CLI tool `@threlte/gltf` to generate a reusable Svelte component from our model.

Run `npx @threlte/gltf@latest /path/to/model.gltf` to generate a Svelte component from your model.
This will generate a file called `Model.svelte` in the same directory as your model. This is how a generated component looks like:

```svelte
<!--
Auto-generated by: https://github.com/threlte/threlte/tree/main/packages/gltf
Command: npx @threlte/gltf@0.0.5 Flower.glb
-->
<script>
  import { Group } from 'three'
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { useGltf } from '@threlte/extras'

  export const ref = new Group()

  const gltf = useGltf('/Flower.glb')
</script>

{#if $gltf}
  <T
    is={ref}
    {...$$restProps}
  >
    <T.Mesh
      geometry={$gltf.nodes.Blossom.geometry}
      material={$gltf.materials.Blossom}
      rotation={[Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]}
      scale={1.22}
    />
    <T.Mesh
      geometry={$gltf.nodes.Stem.geometry}
      material={$gltf.materials.Stem}
      rotation={[Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]}
      scale={1.22}
    />

    <slot {ref} />
  </T>
{/if}
```

The generated component will still use the cache and will only reinstaniate parts of the model that make it reusable.
This practice reduces network requests, bandwidth, memory usage and improves the performance of your Threlte application.

You can then import this component and use it in your application:

```svelte
<script>
  import Model from './Model.svelte'
</script>

<!-- Use props to transform your model -->
<Model
  position.x={2}
  scale={2}
/>

<!-- Reuse it across your application -->
<Model
  position.x={10}
  scale={1.5}
  rotation.y={Math.PI / 2}
/>

<!-- Nest other components in it -->
<Model
  position.x={10}
  scale={1.5}
  rotation.y={Math.PI / 2}
>
  <!-- <OtherModel /> -->
</Model>
```

### Convenient: useGltf

`@threlte/extras` provides a handy hook for loading one-off `.gltf` models called `useGltf`:

```svelte
<script>
  import { useGltf } from '@threlte/extras'
</script>

{#await useGltf('/assets/model.gltf') then gltf}
  <T is={gltf.scene} />
{/await}
```

<Tip

  title="Model Is Cached"

  Keep in mind that this hook caches the result and therefore is most suitable for loading models
  that are placed in the scene only once.
</Tip>

## Loading Textures

To start off, we import the `TextureLoader` from `three` and the `useLoader` hook from `@threlte/core`:

```ts
import { TextureLoader } from 'three'
import { useLoader } from '@threlte/core'
```

Then we can use the `useLoader` hook to load our texture:

```ts
const texture = useLoader(TextureLoader).load('/assets/texture.png')
```

The type of `texture` is a custom store that Threlte provides called `AsyncWritable`. It's very much like a regular Svelte store but with a few extra features. Its value will be `undefined` until the texture has loaded. Once the texture has loaded, the value will be the loaded texture. To use this texture on a material, we can use a conditional:

```svelte
{#if $texture}
  <T.MeshStandardMaterial map={$texture} />
{/if}
```

Since the underlying promise properties `then` and `catch` are exposed on the store itself, we can also make use of that and _await_ the texture to be loaded:

```svelte
<!-- Here, "texture" is acting like a regular promise -->
{#await texture then value}
  <T.MeshStandardMaterial map={value} />
{/await}
```

### Loading multiple textures

Some materials are composed of multiple textures for different material channels. `useLoader` provides a way to load multiple textures at once and _spread_ the loaded textures on a material. Let's say we want to load a texture for the `map` and `normalMap` channels:

```ts
const textures = useLoader(TextureLoader).load({
  map: '/assets/texture.png',
  normalMap: '/assets/normal.png'
})
```

We can then spread the textures on a material via Svelte's spread syntax:

```svelte
{#if $textures}
  <T.MeshStandardMaterial {...$textures} />
{/if}
```

<Tip type="tip">
  Keep in mind that the promise only resolves and the store gets populated once all textures have
  loaded.
</Tip>

### Applying different textures to different faces

To declaratively apply two different textures to two different faces of a `BoxGeometry`, set the `attach` prop to a function.

```svelte
<T.Mesh>
  <T.BoxGeometry />
  <T.MeshStandardMaterial
    map={texture1}
    attach={(parent, self) => {
      if (Array.isArray(parent.material)) parent.material = [...parent.material, self]
      else parent.material = [self]
    }}
  />
  <T.MeshStandardMaterial
    map={texture2}
    attach={(parent, self) => {
      if (Array.isArray(parent.material)) parent.material = [...parent.material, self]
      else parent.material = [self]
    }}
  />
</T.Mesh>
```

Alternatively, mix declaritive and normal three.js code like so for the same result:

```svelte
<script>
  // imports and other code
  const customMaterials = [
    new MeshStandardMaterial({ map: texture1 }),
    new MeshStandardMaterial({ map: texture2 })
  ]
  // ...
</script>

<T.Mesh>
  <T.BoxGeometry />
  <T
    is={customMaterials}
    attach="material"
  />
</T.Mesh>
```

### Convenient: useTexture

`@threlte/extras` provides a handy hook for loading textures called `useTexture`:

```svelte
<script>
  import { useTexture } from '@threlte/extras'
</script>

{#await useTexture('/assets/texture.png') then texture}
  <T.MeshStandardMaterial map={texture} />
{/await}
```

## Context Awareness

The hooks `useLoader`, `useTexture` and `useGltf` are **context aware**. This means that they will automatically use the context of a parent `<Canvas>` component to make sure assets are only cached **in the context of the current Threlte app**. You can't use them outside of a `<Canvas>` component, in a component that is not a child of a `<Canvas>` component, or outside of component initialization. If you know how to use Svelte's `onMount` hook then you know how to use `useLoader` and `useTexture`.

To load assets _outside_ of a components initialization you can separate instantiating the loader from loading the asset all while making use of asset caching:

```svelte
<script>
  import { AudioLoader } from 'three'
  import { useLoader } from '@threlte/core'

  // Instantiate the loader at component initialization
  const loader = useLoader(AudioLoader)

  const onSomeEvent = async () => {
    // Load the asset when needed
    const audioBuffer = await loader.load('/assets/sound.mp3')
  }
</script>
```
