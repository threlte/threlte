</Tip>

Threlte brings Three.js to Svelte in a **declarative** and **state-driven** way.
It provides strictly typed components for deep **reactivity** and **interactivity** out-of-the-box.

Threlte is split into distinct packages so you can import only what you need:

- [@threlte/core](/docs/reference/core/getting-started) provides simple, transparent Svelte binding to Three.js:

  - [`<T>`](/docs/reference/core/t) is the **main building block** of any Threlte application. It is a thin, declarative wrapper for any Three.js class.

  - [Plugins](/docs/learn/advanced/plugins) extend behavior for `<T>` components.

- [@threlte/extras](/docs/reference/extras/getting-started) is a collection of plugins and components that add additional functionality.

- [@threlte/gltf](/docs/reference/gltf/getting-started) is a command-line tool that turns GLTF assets into declarative and re-usable Threlte components.

- [@threlte/rapier](/docs/reference/rapier/getting-started) provides components to enable performant physics in your Threlte application through the [Rapier engine](https://rapier.rs/).

- [@threlte/theatre](/docs/reference/theatre/getting-started) provides components to enable animations in your Threlte application through the [Theatre.js animation library](https://www.theatrejs.com/).

- [@threlte/xr](/docs/reference/xr/getting-started) provides components for VR and AR.

- [@threlte/flex](/docs/reference/flex/getting-started) provides components to easily use the flex engine [`yoga-layout`](https://yogalayout.com/) with Threlte.
