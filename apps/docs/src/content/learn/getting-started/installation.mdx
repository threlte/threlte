To start using Threlte install the packages you want to use in your project.

Threlte consists of 7 packages which can be installed and used individually.
`@threlte/core` and Three.js itself are required for all projects while the
other packages are optional.
[`@threlte/gltf`](/docs/reference/gltf/getting-started) does not need to be
installed separately as it can be used with `npx`, the resulting Threlte
components however require `@threlte/extras` to be installed.

### Choose the packages you want to use
