import ManualInstallGuide from '$components/ManualInstallGuide/ManualInstallGuide.svelte'

Install only what you need. `three` and `@threlte/core` are the minimum required to get going. The remaining packages can be added anytime.

[`@threlte/gltf`](/docs/reference/gltf/getting-started) doesnâ€™t require installation, instead run it with `npx`.
The components generated by `@threlte/gltf` require `@threlte/extras` to be installed.

### Choose the packages you want to use
