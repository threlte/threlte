<Tip type="experimental">
  The WebGPU specification is still in active development. WebGPU support in Three.js is in an early
  stage and is subject to frequent breaking changes. As of now, we do not recommend using WebGPU in
  production.
</Tip>

<Tip type="warning">
  We highly recommend targeting [version r171](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/releases/tag/r171)
  onwards because of potential [duplication and configuration
  issues](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/29404).
</Tip>

## WebGPU

To use Three.js's WebGPU renderer, import it and then initialize it within your
`<Canvas>`'s `createRenderer` prop.

```svelte title="App.svelte" {4}+ {8-14}+
<script>
  import Scene from './Scene.svelte'
  import { Canvas } from '@threlte/core'
  import { WebGPURenderer } from 'three/webgpu'
</script>

<Canvas
  createRenderer={(canvas) => {
    return new WebGPURenderer({
      canvas,
      antialias: true,
      forceWebGL: false
    })
  }}
>
  <Scene />
</Canvas>
```

<Tip type="note">
  WebGPU is still an experimental browser api and at the time of writing has [limited availability
  across major browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=webgpu). For this reason, Three.js's webgpu
  renderer fallbacks to webgl when webgpu is not available.
</Tip>
<Tip type="tip">
  This same approach can be used to swap out the default renderer for any other custom renderer.

  example](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=webgpu#webgpu_performance_renderbundle).

The WebGPU renderer doesn't immediately render. If the renderer you provide needs to delay rendering, you
can defer rendering by initially setting the renderMode to `manual` like so:

```svelte title="App.svelte"
<script>
  import { Canvas, T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { WebGPURenderer } from 'three/webgpu'
  let renderMode = $state('manual')
</script>

<Canvas
  {renderMode}
  createRenderer={(canvas) => {
    const renderer = new WebGPURenderer({
      canvas,
      antialias: true,
      forceWebGL: false
    })
    renderer.init().then(() => {
      renderMode = 'on-demand'
    })
    return renderer
  }}
>
  <Scene />
</Canvas>
```

### Vite

WebGPU uses top-level async to determine WebGPU compatibility. Vite
will often throw an error when it detects this.

To circumvent this issue, the following can be added to your Vite config.

```js
// vite.config.js
optimizeDeps: {
  esbuildOptions: {
    target: 'esnext'
  }
},
build: {
  target: 'esnext'
}
```

Alternatively,
[`vite-plugin-top-level-await`](https://github.com/Menci/vite-plugin-top-level-await)
can be used, although less success has been reported with this method.

## TSL

A question that comes up often in Three.js development is "How do I extend Three.js's materials?".
External libraries such as [three-custom-shader-material](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three-custom-shader-material)
use a find and replace solution to get this job done. Three.js has identified
that it's not an ideal solution and recommends using the [Three.js Shading Language](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language) or TSL for short.

The example below is an adaptation of [this](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=tsl#webgpu_tsl_angular_slicing)
Three.js example. There are many more [TSL examples](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=tsl)
within Three.js that you can use or adapt for your project.

<Example path="shaders/slice/main" />

### Using the \<T> catalogue

The `<T>` component uses all the exports from `three`. It will error on things like
`<T.MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial />` because the `MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial` class is an
export of `three/webgpu` not `three`. You have a few options to work this out.

1. Extend `<T>` with all the definitions from `three/webgpu` by using the [`extend`](/docs/reference/core/t#extending-the-default-component-catalogue)
   function. Adding all of the definitions will increase the bundle size of your application because both `three` and `three/webgpu` will be imported in a non-tree-shakeable way.

```svelte title="App.svelte" {3-4}+ {6}+
<script>
  import Scene from './Scene.svelte'
  import { Canvas, extend } from '@threlte/core'
  import * as THREE from 'three/webgpu'

  extend(THREE)
</script>

<Canvas
  createRenderer={(canvas) => {
    return new THREE.WebGPURenderer({
      canvas,
      antialias: true,
      forceWebGL: false
    })
  }}
>
  <Scene />
</Canvas>
```

2. Use explicit imports for the objects, functions, and other classes that you use from `three/webgpu`.
   You can then use `<T>`'s [`is`](/docs/reference/core/t#property-is) prop with those imports from `three/webgpu`.

```svelte title="Scene.svelte" {3}+ {5}+ {10}+
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial } from 'three/webgpu'

	const material = new MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial()
</script>

<T.Mesh>
	<T.BoxGeometry>
	<T is={material}>
</T.Mesh>
```

3. Same as option #2 but using [`extend`](/docs/reference/core/t#extending-the-default-component-catalogue) with the imports so that you can have `<T.MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial />` etc...

```svelte title="App.svelte" {3-4}+ {6}+
<script>
  import Scene from './Scene.svelte'
  import { Canvas, extend } from '@threlte/core'
  import { WebGPURenderer, MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial } from 'three/webgpu'

  extend({ MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial })
</script>

<Canvas
  createRenderer={(canvas) => {
    return new WebGPURenderer({
      canvas,
      antialias: true,
      forceWebGL: false
    })
  }}
>
  <Scene />
</Canvas>
```

```svelte title="Scene.svelte"
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
</script>

<T.Mesh>
  <T.BoxGeometry />
  <T.MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial />
</T.Mesh>
```

Options 2 and 3 will keep the bundle size of your application small but you'll have to keep it updated as you go.

#### Careful! `three` and `three/webgpu` don't mix well

You will need to overwrite some of the default `<T>` catalogue if you use `three/webgpu`.
For example, if you're using a `MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial`, you need to update any lighing classes you use like so:

```svelte title="App.svelte"
<script>
  import { DirectionalLight, MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial } from 'three/webgpu'

  // tell <T.DirectionalLight> to use the definition from `three/webgpu`
  extend({ MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial, DirectionalLight })
</script>

<Canvas>
  <Scene />
</Canvas>
```

```svelte title="Scene.svelte"
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
</script>

<T.DirectionalLight />

<T.Mesh>
  <T.BoxGeometry />
  <T.MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial />
</T.Mesh>
```

This is because the exports from `three/webgpu` are different than those in `three` and make use of the additional features that node materials have.

<Tip type="tip">
  An easy option for projects is to start with option #1 and then transition to the other options
  when bundle size becomes an issue or you need to ship to production.
</Tip>

### Nodes

The [nodes](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language#nodematerial) can be directly assigned like any other prop on the `<T>` component.

```svelte
<T.MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial
  outputNode={Fn(([arg1, arg2]) => {
    /* ... */
  })(arg1, arg2)}
  shadowNode={Fn(([arg1, arg2]) => {
    /* ... */
  })(arg2, arg2)}
/>
```

Node materials give you the ability to modify three's builtin materials.
In the sliced gear example, two nodes are modified; the `outputNode` and the `shadowNode`.
The `outputNode` is set up in such a way that it discards any fragments that are
outside the permitted `startAngle` and `arcAngle`. If a fragment is not discarded and
it is not front-facing, it is assigned the color in the `color` uniform. The material
needs its `side` set to `THREE.DoubleSide` otherwise three.js will cull them out if they are facing away
from the camera,

Any fragment that is discarded in the shadowNode will not cast shadows.

### Updating Uniforms

If your node uses uniforms, they can be declared in the `script` tag of
the component and updated via `$effect` or a callback.

For example, if your material uses elapsed time in a uniform, you can update the
uniform inside a `useTask` callback.

The material in the example below demonstrates two ways to update uniforms. The `uTime` uniform
is updated in `useTask` whereas `uIntensity` is updated in an `$effect`.

<Example path="shaders/slice/updatingUniforms" />

<Tip type="info">
  Note that TSL has an
  [`oscSine`](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language#oscillator) function
  that oscillates on time that could also be used in the example above.
