<Tip type="warning">
  WebGPU support in Three.js is still in an early stage and is subject to change from Three.js
  version to version.
</Tip>
<Tip type="warning">
  We highly recommend targeting [version r171](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/releases/tag/r171)
  onwards because of potential [duplication and configuration
  issues](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/29404).
</Tip>
## WebGPU

To use Three.js's WebGPU renderer, import it and then initialize it within your
`<Canvas>`'s `createRenderer` prop.

```svelte title="App.svelte" {4}+ {8-14}+
<script>
  import Scene from './Scene.svelte'
  import { Canvas } from '@threlte/core'
  import { WebGPURenderer } from 'three/webgpu'
</script>

<Canvas
  createRenderer={(canvas) => {
    return new WebGPURenderer({
      canvas,
      antialias: true,
      forceWebGL: false
    })
  }}
>
  <Scene />
</Canvas>
```

<Tip type="note">
  WebGPU is still an experimental browser api and at the time of writing has [limited availability
  across major browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=webgpu). For this reason, Three.js's webgpu
  renderer fallbacks to webgl when webgpu is not available.
</Tip>
<Tip type="tip">
  This same approach can be used to swap out the default renderer for any other custom renderer.

  example](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=webgpu#webgpu_performance_renderbundle).

The WebGPU renderer doesn't immediately render. If the renderer you provide needs to delay rendering, you
can defer rendering by initially setting the renderMode to `manual` like so:

```svelte title="App.svelte"
<script>
  import { Canvas, T } from '@threlte/core@next'
  import { WebGPURenderer } from 'three/webgpu'
  let renderMode = $state('manual')
</script>

<Canvas
  {renderMode}
  createRenderer={(canvas) => {
    const renderer = new WebGPURenderer({
      canvas,
      antialias: true,
      forceWebGL: false
    })
    renderer.init().then(() => {
      renderMode = 'on-demand'
    })
    return renderer
  }}
>
  <Scene />
</Canvas>
```

### Vite

WebGPU uses top-level async to determine WebGPU compatibility. Vite
will often throw an error when it detects this.

To circumvent this issue, the following can be added to your Vite config.

```js
// vite.config.js
optimizeDeps: {
  esbuildOptions: {
    target: 'esnext'
  }
},
build: {
  target: 'esnext'
}
```

Alternatively,
[`vite-plugin-top-level-await`](https://github.com/Menci/vite-plugin-top-level-await)
can be used, although less success has been reported with this method.

## TSL

A question that comes up often in Three.js development is "How do I extend Three.js's materials?".
External libraries such as [three-custom-shader-material](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three-custom-shader-material)
use a find and replace solution to get this job done. Three.js has identified
that it's not an ideal solution and recommends using the [Three.js Shading Language](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language) or TSL for short.

The example below is an adaptation of [this](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=tsl#webgpu_tsl_angular_slicing)
Three.js example. There are many more [TSL examples](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=tsl)
within Three.js that you can use or adapt for your project.

<Example path="shaders/slice/main" />

### Using The \<T> Catalogue

`<T>` components use classes, constants, functions, etc. from the `three` library. It will error on things like `<T.MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial />` because the `MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial` class is an export of `three/webgpu` instead of `three`.

1. Extend `<T>` with all the definitions from `three/webgpu` by using the [`extend`](/docs/reference/core/t#extending-the-default-component-catalogue)
   function. Adding all these definitions will increase the bundle size of your application but it is an easy solution.

```svelte title="App.svelte" {3-4}+ {6}+
<script>
  import Scene from './Scene.svelte'
  import { Canvas, extend } from '@threlte/core'
  import * as THREE from 'three/webgpu'

  extend(THREE)
</script>

<Canvas
  createRenderer={(canvas) => {
    return new THREE.WebGPURenderer({
      canvas,
      antialias: true,
      forceWebGL: false
    })
  }}
>
  <Scene />
</Canvas>
```

2. Use explicit imports for the objects, functions, and such that you use from `three/webgpu`.

You can use `<T>`'s [`is`](/docs/reference/core/t#property-is) prop with entities imported from `three/webgpu`.

```svelte title="Scene.svelte" {3}+ {5}+ {10}+
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial } from 'three/webgpu'

	const material = new MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial()
</script>

<T.Mesh>
	<T.BoxGeometry>
	<T is={material}>
</T.Mesh>
```

You can instead use [`extend`](/docs/reference/core/t#extending-the-default-component-catalogue) with just the entities that you use.

```svelte title="App.svelte" {3-4}+ {6}+
<script>
  import Scene from './Scene.svelte'
  import { Canvas, extend } from '@threlte/core'
  import { WebGPURenderer, MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial } from 'three/webgpu'

  extend({ MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial })
</script>

<Canvas
  createRenderer={(canvas) => {
    return new WebGPURenderer({
      canvas,
      antialias: true,
      forceWebGL: false
    })
  }}
>
  <Scene />
</Canvas>
```

Now `<T>` knows about `MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial` and you can use it like you would with anything else.

```svelte title="Scene.svelte"
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
</script>

<T.Mesh>
  <T.MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial />
  <T.BoxGeometry />
</T.Mesh>
```

With this approach the bundle size of your application will remain minimal but you'll have to keep things updated as you go.

An important thing to be mindful of is that if you may need overwrite things in the `<T>` catalogue if you're using `three/webgpu` entities. For example, if you're using a `MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial`, you may will need to update any lighing components in your scene.

```svelte title="App.svelte"
<script>
  import { DirectionalLight, MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial } from 'three/webgpu'

  // tell <T.DirectionalLight> to use the definition from three/webgpu
  extend({ MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial, DirectionalLight })
</script>

<Canvas>
  <Scene />
</Canvas>
```

```svelte title="Scene.svelte"
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
</script>

<T.DirectionalLight />

<T.Mesh>
  <T.MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial />
  <T.BoxGeometry />
</T.Mesh>
```

This is because the definitions from `three/webgpu` are different than those in `three` and make use of the additional features that node materials have.

<Tip type="tip">
  An easy option for projects is to start with option #1 and then transition to option #2 when
  bundle size becomes an issue. If you choose option #1 you also don't need to be sure to use
  correct lights in your application.
</Tip>

### Nodes

The [nodes](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language#nodematerial) can be directly assigned like any other prop on the `<T>` component.

```svelte
<T.MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial
  outputNode={Fn(([arg1, arg2]) => {
    /* ... */
  })(arg1, arg2)}
  shadowNode={Fn(([arg1, arg2]) => {
    /* ... */
  })(arg2, arg2)}
/>
```

Node materials give you the ability to modify three's builtin materials.
In the sliced gear example, two nodes are modified; the `outputNode` and the `shadowNode`.
The `outputNode` is set up in such a way that it discards any fragments that are
outside the permitted `startAngle` and `arcAngle`. If a fragment is not discarded and
it is not front-facing, it is assigned the color in the `color` uniform. The material
needs its `side` set to `THREE.DoubleSide` otherwise three.js will cull them out if they are facing away
from the camera,

Any fragment that is discarded in the shadowNode will not cast shadows.

### Updating Uniforms

If your node uses uniforms, they can be declared in the `script` tag of
the component and updated via `$effect` or a callback.

For example, if your material uses elapsed time in a uniform, you can update the
uniform inside a `useTask` callback.

The material in the example below demonstrates two ways to update uniforms. The `uTime` uniform
is updated in `useTask` whereas `uIntensity` is updated in an `$effect`.

<Example path="shaders/slice/updatingUniforms" />

<Tip type="info">
  Note that TSL has an
  [`oscSine`](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language#oscillator) function
  that oscillates on time that could also be used in the example above.
