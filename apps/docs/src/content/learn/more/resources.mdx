The Three.js community is constantly evolving and expanding. Whether you are a beginner
looking to get started or an experienced developer seeking advanced knowledge,
there are available resources that offer a wealth of information and technologies to help.

## Threlte's underlying libraries

The following libraries are foundational to understanding Threlte's architecture, functionalities and packages:

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - 3D graphics on the web. Three.js serves as the backbone for rendering and creating 3D scenes in Threlte.
- [Rapier](https://www.rapier.rs/) - A library for real-time physics simulations. Rapier helps bring your Threlte projects to life with dynamic interactions.
- [Theatre.js](https://www.theatrejs.com/) - Focuses on timeline-based animations and offers intricate control over complex animations, making it easier to manage complex state changes in Threlte.

## General

- [Three.js Resources](https://threejsresources.com/) - A hub for all things 3D. From tools to textures, lighting & more.

## Shaders

GLSL (Graphics Library Shader Language) is a critical part of shader programming, which is central to achieving high-quality visual effects in Threlte.

- [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) - This resource breaks down complex shader programming into bite-sized lessons. A great starting point for anyone new to shaders.
- [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) - An in-depth resource for learning OpenGL and GLSL, covering topics from beginner to advanced levels. Learn OpenGL offers tutorials that are easily applicable to Threlte's context.

We hope you find these resources valuable in your journey to mastering Threlte. Happy Learning!
