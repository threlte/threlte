title: 3D gaussian splat
---

[3D Gaussian Splatting](https://huggingface.co/blog/gaussian-splatting) is a
rasterization technique that allows to render 3D objects with a high level of
detail. It's currently quickly gaining popularity because of the photorealistic
rendering of 3D scan data. This example shows how to implement 3D Gaussian
Splatting with the help of two libraries:

- [`@lumaai/luma-web`](https://lumalabs.ai/luma-web-library) by [Luma](https://lumalabs.ai/)
- [`@pmndrs/vanilla`](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei-vanilla)

<Tip type="experimental">
  The technology presented in this example is rapidly developing and therefore the components are
  not part of the [`@threlte/extras`](/docs/reference/extras/getting-started) package *as of now*.
  You may however copy and paste them into your project and use them as you wish.
