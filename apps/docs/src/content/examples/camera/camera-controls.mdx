You may have come up against limitations with Three.js's `<OrbitalControls/>`.
[Camera Controls](https://github.com/yomotsu/camera-controls) is a suitable alternative
which supports smooth transitions and a variety of additional features.

<Example path="camera/camera-controls" />

The `CameraControls` class in the example _extends_ the camera-controls library's
`CameraControls` class.

It automatically installs `camera-controls` if not already installed when a new instance is created and connects the instance to the `element` passed into its constructor.

## Updating the Controls

Updating the controls happens in a task in the `<Scene>` component.

The controls are disposed when the `<Scene>` component unmounts. This is an important step because it removes all the event listeners that are added when the CameraControls instance is created and connected to the dom.

You could put both of these actions in the constructor of the `CameraControls` class if you didn't want to do it in the component but be careful using threlte's [`useTask`](/docs/reference/core/use-task) since it accesses context set up by the [`<Canvas>`](/docs/reference/core/canvas) component.

### Prevent SSR Externalization

If you are using SvelteKit or Vite for building your app, you may need to externalize the `camera-controls` library.

To externalize the `camera-controls` library put the following in your `vite.config.js` or `vite.config.ts`.

```typescript {4-6}+
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [sveltekit()],
  ssr: {
    noExternal: ['camera-controls']
  }
})
```
