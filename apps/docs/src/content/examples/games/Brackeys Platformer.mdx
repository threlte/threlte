Brackeys is a well-known youtuber who's content centers around game
development. This example is a rough copy of a recent [beginner
tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0) he made. Although the
video is about [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), we've remade it in threlte ðŸŽ‰

Give it a whirl, copy parts, remix it - have fun ðŸ˜„

# The journey

## Basics

Threejs's `Sprite` is a plane that always face the camera and cannot cast
shadows. The `SpriteMaterial` is transparent by default, isn't affected by
lighting and generally has a single static texture. All of that can be a
drawback so using a normal `Mesh`, `PlaneGeometry` and `MeshStandardMaterial`
is a valid option.

## SpriteSheets

A common pattern in 2D graphics is to pack sprites into one texture called a
spritesheet.

### Multiple static Sprites

The sheet data for the sprite frames within the texture can be given using the `data` prop

The fruit example:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { SpriteSheetMaterial, type SpriteSheetData } from '@threlte/extras'

  const data = {
    frames: [
      {
        x: 0,
        y: 48,
        width: 16,
        height: 16,
        name: 'apple_red'
      },
      {
        x: 16,
        y: 16,
        width: 16,
        height: 16,
        name: 'pear_orange'
      },
      {
        x: 32,
        y: 0,
        width: 16,
        height: 16,
        name: 'grapes_green'
      }
    ]
  } satisfies SpriteSheetData

  const selectedSprite = 'apple_red'
</script>

<T.Mesh>
  <T.PlaneGeometry />
  <SpriteSheetMaterial
    textureUrl="/textures/sprites/fruit.png"
    {data}
    {selectedSprite}
  />
</T.Mesh>
```
