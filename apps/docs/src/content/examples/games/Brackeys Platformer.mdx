# The journey

## Basics

Threejs's `Sprite` is a plane that always face the camera and cannot cast
shadows. The `SpriteMaterial` is transparent by default, isn't affected by
lighting and generally has a single static texture. All of that can be a
drawback so using a normal `Mesh`, `PlaneGeometry` and `MeshStandardMaterial`
is a valid option.

## SpriteSheets

A common pattern in 2D graphics is to pack sprites into one texture called a
spritesheet.

### Multiple static Sprites

The trees

### Animated Sprites

The coin and the knight
