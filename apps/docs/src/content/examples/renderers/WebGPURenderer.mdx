title: WebGPURenderer
---

This example shows how to run the experimental Three.js WebGPURenderer renderer
with Threlte's `<Canvas>`.

<Example path="renderers/WebGPU" />

<small>
  Adapted from [this Three.js
  example](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=webgpu#webgpu_performance_renderbundle).
</small>

In a browser that supports WebGPU, such as Chrome, this example will default to
the new WebGPURenderer. In other browsers, it will fallback to a WebGL Renderer.

<Tip type="warning">
  WebGPU support in Three.js is still in an early stage and the implementation may change from
  Three.js version to version. This guide is based on Three.js r169.
</Tip>

### Using the Three.js WebGPU build

Since [Three.js r167](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/releases/tag/r167),
Three.js provides a dedicated WebGPU build, available as `three/webgpu`.
Whenever you're targeting WebGPU, you must always import the WebGPU build
instead of the default `three` build:

```ts {1}- {2}+
import * as THREE from 'three'
import * as THREE from 'three/webgpu'
```

You also need to extend the Threlte catalogue with the WebGPU build. This
enables the `<T>` component to pick up the WebGPU build as well.

```svelte title="App.svelte"
<script>
  import { extend } from '@threlte/core'
  import Scene from './Scene.svelte'
  import * as THREE from 'three/webgpu'

  extend(THREE)
</script>

<Canvas
  createRenderer={(canvas) => {
    return new THREE.WebGPURenderer({
      canvas,
      antialias: true,
      forceWebGL: false
    })
  }}
>
  <Scene />
</Canvas>
```

### Vite

The WebGPURenderer uses top-level async to determine WebGPU compatibility. Vite
will often throw an error when it detects top level await.

To circumvent this issue, the following can be added to your Vite config.

```js
// vite.config.js
optimizeDeps: {
  esbuildOptions: {
    target: 'esnext'
  }
},
build: {
  target: 'esnext'
}
```

Alternatively,
[`vite-plugin-top-level-await`](https://github.com/Menci/vite-plugin-top-level-await)
can be used, although less success has been reported with this method.
