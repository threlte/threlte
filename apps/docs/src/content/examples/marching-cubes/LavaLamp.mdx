<Example path="marching-cubes/lava-lamp" />

[Threejs's marching cubes addon](https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_marchingcubes.html) is a little too limited to be ported into a component but this example shows how it might be incorported into threlte.

## Placement

`MarchingCubes` defines a space from -1 to 1 for all 3 axes.

### MarchingPlane

The original example only allows for planes positioned at x = -1, y = -1, and z = -1.

### MarchingCube

`<MarchingCube>`s can be placed anywhere in the `MarchingCubes` space. If they are placed outside this range they mab be cutoff or not show altogether.

<Tip type="info">
  Even though `MarchingCube` appears as a ball, it is called __Cube__ to be inline with [drei's
  MarchingCubes abstration](https://drei.docs.pmnd.rs/abstractions/marching-cubes).
</Tip>

## Materials

The example above utilizes vertex coloring but the original threejs example has support for any kind of material. Vertex coloring requires a little more memory since each vertex now carries a color with it. If you're not using vertex colors, you can leave `enableColors` turned off. The `<MarchingCubes>` component uses the same default material that `Three.Mesh`es do. Setting different materials is the same process as setting different materials for `<T.Mesh>`.

```svelte
<MarchingCubes>
  <T.MeshNormalMaterial />
  <MarchingCube />
</MarchingCubes>
```

or

```svelte
<script>
  import { MeshNormalMaterial } from 'three'

  const material = new MeshNormalMaterial()
</script>

<MarchingCubes {material}>
  <MarchingCube />
</MarchingCubes>
```

If you're using a material with a texture, you will need to set `enableUvs` to true.

```svelte
<MarchingCubes enableUvs>
  <T.MeshNormalMaterial map={texture} />
  <MarchingCube />
</MarchingCubes>
```

Note that the example above enables both uvs and vertex coloring for demonstration purposes. You can set these to false in the constructor to save on space.

```svelte title="MarchingCubes.svelte" {5}
<script>
  // ...

  // don't allocate buffers for vertex colors nor uvs
  const marchingCubes = new MarchingCubes(resolution, material, false, false, 20_000)

  // ...
</script>
```
