This is a practical example showing a best-practice method of implementing LOD in Threlte. The example is a great demonstration of the power of [ref](../../reference/core/t) bindings.

This is an adaption of Three.js [own documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/LOD), and therefore it's also a great way to learn how to translate what you already know how to do with imperative three.js, into declerative Threlte code.

<Example path="geometry/LOD" />

### How does it work

1. First `<T>` creates the geometry and material
2. Then it attaches those to the mesh
3. `on:create` will run later, but we remember to use a reference to the mesh itself `ref` and a reference `lod` to the parent LOD object.

... which happens 3 times due to the `#each` block

```svelte
<T.LOD let:ref={lod}>
  {#each ['red', 'green', 'blue'] as color, i}
    <T.Mesh
      on:create={({ ref }) => {
        lod.addLevel(ref, i * 75) // i * 75 = distance
      }}
    >
      <T.IcosahedronGeometry args={[10, 3 - i]} />
      <T.MeshStandardMaterial
        {color}
        wireframe
      />
    </T.Mesh>
  {/each}
</T.LOD>
```

5. `<T>` now creates the LOD parent and internally calls the three.js function `lod.add(child)` on each mesh, since they are defined inside the `<T.LOD>` object.
6. However, in three.js we need the `lod.addLevel(child, distance)` as well to register the children as LOD levels and not just attached children.
7. This is where our `on:create` function comes in - upon creation of each mesh, we are able to call `lod.addLevel(child, distance)`
