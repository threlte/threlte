This example shows how to include user-generated random terrain as a fixed [`<RigidBody>`](/docs/reference/rapier/rigid-body), within a Rapier world.

This is an adaption of Rapier's [demo](https://rapier.rs/demos3d/index.html) (select "Demo: triangle mesh").

## Heightfield colliders

A heightmap is generated by looping over the vertices of a plane geometry. The height information is passed to a [`<Collider>`](/docs/reference/rapier/collider) and wrapped in a `<RigidBody>`.

```svelte
<RigidBody type="fixed">
  <Collider
    shape="heightfield"
    args={[nsubdivs, nsubdivs, heights, scale]}
  />
</RigidBody>
```

Giving the `<RigidBody>` a `"fixed"` type prevents it from being affected by gravity.

In the `<FallingShapes>` component, a bunch of random geometries are positioned above the plane and dropped. Each geometry is wrapped in a `<RigidBody>` with a type of `"dynamic"`. This will cause it to be affected by gravity.
