Noise is often used in graphics and game development to create "smooth randomness".

Three.js has a `SimplexNoise` addon that can be used for this purpose. In the example below, it is used to generate a smooth random surface.

<Example path="geometry/terrain" />

## Setting the Height of Each Vertex

After the geometry is created, the z-value of each vertex's position is set with a value generated from the noise function.

```typescript
const noise = new SimplexNoise()

for (let i = 0; i < positions.count; i += 1) {
  const x = positions.getX(i) / flatness
  const y = positions.getY(i) / flatness
  positions.setZ(i, noise.noise(x, y))
}
```

The `flatness` variable scales down the `x` and `y` values that are passed to the noise function. A higher `flatness` value corresponds to smaller changes between noise values thus a flatter surface.

<Tip type="warning">
  When updating attributes of a geometry after the first render, you may have to set
  `attribute.needsUpdate` to `true`. It may also be necessary to recalculate the geometry's vertex
  normals using `geometry.computeVertexNormals()`.
</Tip>

## Rotating the geometry

One important thing to note is that the plane geometry is created in the xy-plane. This is why the z-value is treated as the height of the vertex and the geometry is rotated 90 degrees. The Z-up coordinate system is common to see in such areas as structural design and 3D-printing.

## Deterministic noise values

`SimplexNoise.noise` is deterministic. In other words, when given the same `x` and `y`, the output is always the same. If you want to produce different results, you can offset the `x` and `y` inputs by some amount.

```typescript {4}+ {6-7}
const noise = new SimplexNoise()

$effect(() => {
  const randomOffset = Math.random()
  for (let i = 0; i < positions.count; i += 1) {
    const x = positions.getX(i) / flatness + randomOffset
    const y = positions.getY(i) / flatness + randomOffset
    positions.setZ(i, noise.noise(x, y))
  }

  // ...
})
```
