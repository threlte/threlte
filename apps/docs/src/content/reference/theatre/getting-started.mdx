[Theatre.js](https://www.theatrejs.com/) is a javascript animation library with a professional motion design toolset. It helps you create any animation, from cinematic scenes in 3D, to delightful UI interactions.

### Concepts

As with the rest of Threlte, `@threlte/theatre` provides an idiomatic yet transparent Svelte wrapper. The core concepts of `@threlte/theatre` are:

| @threlte/theatre Component        | Description                                                             | Corresponding Theatre.js Concept(s)                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [\<Project\>](./project)          | Contains your project's animation sheets                                | [Project](https://www.theatrejs.com/docs/latest/manual/projects)                                                                                                                              |
| [\<Sheet\>](./sheet)              | Binds to an animation _sheet_ that contains animation sequences         | [Sheet](https://www.theatrejs.com/docs/latest/manual/sheets)                                                                                                                                  |
| [\<Sequence\>](./sequence)        | Binds to an animation _sequence_ and contains the animated components   | [Sequence](https://www.theatrejs.com/docs/latest/manual/sequences)                                                                                                                            |
| [\<Studio\>](./studio)            | Enables the Theatre.js in-browser studio _interface_ during development | [Studio](https://www.theatrejs.com/docs/latest/manual/Studio)                                                                                                                                 |
| [\<SheetObject\>](./sheet-object) | Enables editing and animating its parent in the studio interface        | [Sheet Object](https://www.theatrejs.com/docs/latest/manual/objects)                                                                                                                          |
| [\<Theatre\>](./theatre)          | A helper component providing a project with a single sheet and a studio | [Project](https://www.theatrejs.com/docs/latest/manual/projects), [Sheet](https://www.theatrejs.com/docs/latest/manual/sheets), [Studio](https://www.theatrejs.com/docs/latest/manual/Studio) |

The `@threlte/theatre` documentation cross-references [the Theatre.js documentation](https://www.theatrejs.com/docs/latest), allowing you to get a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts.

### Workflow

Theatre.js combines programming in your IDE with editing in a browser-based GUI. The core workflow looks something like this:

1. **Create** your scene as usual, placing a `<Project>` and one or more `<Sheets>` in your `<Canvas>`.
2. **Identify** the elements and props you wish to edit in the `<Studio>`, and place an `<SheetObject>` component around them, then use the slotted components `<Sync>`, `<Declare>` or `<Transform>` to add editable props.
3. **Edit** props and animations of elements in the `<Studio>` in the browser; [config state](https://www.theatrejs.com/docs/latest/manual/projects#state) is autosaved to local storage.
4. **Export** the updated state [as a JSON file](https://www.theatrejs.com/docs/latest/manual/projects#state) by selecting your project in the studio and clicking export (top-right corner).
5. **Import** your scene's `state.json` and use it in your `<Project>`'s `config` prop.

### Installation

```bash copy
npm install @threlte/theatre @theatre/core @theatre/studio
```

### Quick Start

To get started quickly, encapsulate your whole scene in the component [`<Theatre>`](./theatre).

<Tip type="tip">
  The component `<Theatre>` provides a default [`<Project>`](/theatre/project) and [`<Sheet>`](/theatre/sheet) and implements [`<Studio>`](/theatre/studio). For a more flexible structure please consider using `<Project>`, `<Sheet>` and `<Studio>` on their own.
</Tip>

```svelte title=App.svelte {3,8,10}+
<script lang="ts">
  import { Canvas } from '@threlte/core'
  import { Theatre } from '@threlte/theatre'
  import Scene from './Scene.svelte'
</script>

<Canvas>
  <Theatre>
    <Scene />
  </Theatre>
</Canvas>
```

In your Scene, add the component `<SheetObject>` as a parent of any component you'd wish to edit or animate. The component `<SheetObject>` provides the components `<Sync>`, `<Declare>` and `<Transform>` that allow you to manipulate properties in Theatre.js based on your Threlte markup.

<Tip type="tip">
  The component `<Transform>` is a shortcut to add `position`, `scale` and `rotation` at once as
  well as mount handy `<TransformControls>` whenever the respective Sheet Object is selected in the studio.
</Tip>

```svelte title=Scene.svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { OrbitControls } from '@threlte/extras'
  import { SheetObject } from '@threlte/theatre'
</script>

<T.PerspectiveCamera
  position={[0, 5, 10]}
  makeDefault
>
  <OrbitControls target={{ y: 1.5 }} />
</T.PerspectiveCamera>

<!-- Box -->
<SheetObject key="Box">
  {#snippet children({ Transform, Sync })}
    <Transform>
      <T.Mesh
        receiveShadow
        castShadow
        position.y={0.5}
      >
        <T.BoxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
        <T.MeshStandardMaterial color="#b00d03">
          <Sync
            color
            roughness
            metalness
          />
        </T.MeshStandardMaterial>
      </T.Mesh>
    </Transform>
  {/snippet}
</SheetObject>
```

You will now see the Theatre.js studio interface. Make yourself comfortable with the controls and if you haven't done yet, please read the Theatre.js [studio manual](https://www.theatrejs.com/docs/0.5/manual/Studio) and [keyboard shortcuts](https://www.theatrejs.com/docs/0.5/manual/keyboard-shortcuts).
