Use the component `<Sync>` from the [`<SheetObject>`](./sheet-object) slot prop to automatically pick up properties from its parent.

```svelte
<SheetObject>
  {#snippet children({ Sync })}
    <T.MeshBasicMaterial>
      <Sync
        color
        roughness
        rotation
      />
    </T.MeshBasicMaterial>
  {/snippet}
</SheetObject>
```

<Tip type="info">
  #### Special Properties Note that some properties are treated differently. The `rotation` prop and
  other properties with type `THREE.Euler` are automatically converted from radians to degrees.
  Properties like `color` which have a type of `THREE.Color` receive a color picker in the studio
  automatically.
</Tip>

## Labeled Prop

To label an auto prop, just provide a string instead of a boolean value.

```svelte
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { SheetObject } from '@threlte/theatre'
</script>

<SheetObject key="cube">
  {#snippet children({ Sync })}
    <T.Mesh>
      <T.BoxGeometry />
      <T.MeshStandardMaterial>
        <!-- labeled prop: rename color to tone in the studio -->
        <Sync color="tone" />
      </T.MeshStandardMaterial>
    </T.Mesh>
  {/snippet}
</SheetObject>
```

## Pierced Prop

Similarly to the pierced props of [`<T>`](/docs/reference/core/t), the props of the component `<Sync>` can be anotated in the same fashion.

```svelte
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { SheetObject } from '@threlte/theatre'
</script>

<SheetObject key="cube">
  {#snippet children({ Sync })}
    <T.Mesh>
      <!-- pierced prop: edit only x coord. in the studio -->
      <Sync position.x />
      <T.BoxGeometry />
      <T.MeshStandardMaterial />
    </T.Mesh>
  {/snippet}
</SheetObject>
```

## Transformers

The component `<Sync>` uses transformers to provide the best possible editing
experience in the Theatre.js studio based on the type of the property. Sometimes
this is not desireable and you may want to go further. One example is the
property `intensity` on lights. By default, it's a regular numerical input, but
in practice it makes sense to have a range slider that lets you select numbers from 0 to e.g. 10.

To create a transformer that can be reused, you are provided a utility function:

```ts
import { createTransformer } from '@threlte/theatre'
import { types } from '@theatre/core'

const intensity = createTransformer({
  transform(value) {
    return types.number(value, {
      range: [0, 10]
    })
  },
  apply(target, path, value) {
    target[path] = value
  }
})
```

The `transform` function is used to transform the value of a certain Three.js objects proerty to a property that Theatre.js can use in an `ISheetObject`. To ensure compatibility with the rest of the package, the return value must be any one of the functions available at Theatre.js' `types`.

The `apply` function is used to apply the value to the target. `target` is the parent object of the property (usually a Three.js object), `path` is the name of the property and `value` is the value to apply.

You may also declare transformers directly in the markup:

```svelte
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { SheetObject } from '@threlte/theatre'
  import { createTransformer, types } from '@threlte/theatre'
</script>

<SheetObject key="light">
  {#snippet children({ Sync })}
    <T.DirectionalLight>
      <Sync
        intensity={{
          transformer: {
            transform(value) {
              // use the initial value and provide a range
              // slider UI that goes from 0 to 2.
              return types.number(value, {
                range: [0, 2]
              })
            },
            apply(target, path, value) {
              // whenever the value changes, apply it back
              // to the target.
              target[path] = value
            }
          }
        }}
      />
    </T.DirectionalLight>
  {/snippet}
</SheetObject>
```

<Tip type="info" title="Built-in components use transformers internally">

`<Sync>` uses transformers to transform arbitrary props that are _discovered_ by a property path to a value that Theatre.js can handle.
`<Transform>` uses transformers to transform the properties `position`, `rotation` and `scale` of a Three.js object to a value that Theatre.js can handle.
