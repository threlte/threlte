## Overview

The `<SheetObject>` component offers several distinct ways to declare and syncronize props in the Theatre.js studio. Convenient [auto prop APIs](#auto-props) address common usecases and allow
quick and easy prop declaration. Meanwhile, [manual props APIs](#manual-prop) allow full customization of prop declaration. Many of these are offered through [slot props](https://svelte.dev/docs/special-elements#slot-slot-key-value).

<Example path="theatre/sheet-object" />

## Auto Props

The [`<Sync>`](./sync) component automatically infers and synchronizes props of its parent component. Meanwhile the [`<Transform>`](./transform) component creates position and rotation props for its
child components, and adds transform controls to the them.

## Manual Props

Sometimes we want to control prop declaration manually for better control when implementing custom domain
specific props. We can achieve this using _manual prop declaration_. Provide the `props` property to the component
`<SheetObject>` for a manual property declaration.

```svelte
<SheetObject props={{ x: 0 }}>
  {#snippet children({ values })}
    <T.Mesh position.x={values.x} />
  {/snippet}
</SheetObject>
```

You can also use the [`<Declare>`](./declare) prop slot component to colocate your manual declaration with other code.

## Selection

The `<SheetObject>` component offers a slot prop based API for controlling selection in the Theatre.js studio. Simply
declare the `select` and `deselect` methods and the `selected` variables to use it. You then need to use these in the
mesh of your choice; see the example above for a demonstration.
