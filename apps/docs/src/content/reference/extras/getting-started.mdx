The package `'@threlte/extras'` provides components, plugins, hooks and utilities. They are mostly abstractions on top of the `<T/>` component.

## Overview

#### [Shapes, Assets, Sound and Async](#shapes-assets-sound-and-async)

how to load/await models, textures, sounds, display text, insert DOM-like components and adjust the scene hirearchy.

#### [Helpers, Visual guides and Controls](#helpers-visual-guides-and-controls)

Components that create visual aids, change how the camera moves or enable objects to be moved around.

#### [Visual Effects, Materials, Shaders and Post-Processing](#visual-effects-materials-shaders-and-post-processing)

These components change how an object looks, getting effects not possible with standard meshes & lighting.

#### [Transitions, Interactivity, Animation and Staging](#transitions-interactivity-animation-and-staging)

Components to help setup the stage to show off particular objects as well as plugins to bring objects to life and make them user interactive.

#### [Performance, Shadows and Rendering](#performance-shadows-and-rendering)

Dailing in performance with components that reduce draw calls as well as some different solutions for shadows.

## Installation

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install @threlte/extras
```

## Usage

<Tip type="experimental">
  The content of this package can be used directly but it's also meant to be a recipe for creating
  your own abstractions and plugins depending on your use case.
