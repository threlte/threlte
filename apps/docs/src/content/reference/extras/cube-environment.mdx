`<CubeEnvironment>` is almost exactly like \<Enviroment> but it has a few key
differences, namely that its used to load and assign `THREE.CubeTexture`s to
`scene.environment`. Other differences will be listed below. For all other
information please refer to the
[\<Environment>](/docs/reference/extras/environment) documentation.

<Example path="extras/cube-environment/basic" />

## URLs

`<CubeEnvironment>`'s `urls` prop is a six-tuple of textures that comprise a
cube texture. The first file's extension decides which loader to use to load the
files. Refer to the table below to determine which loader is used for each
extension. The order of the `urls` is important. The order is `[positiveX,
negativeX, positiveY, negativeY, positiveZ, negativeZ]`.

| extension  | loader                                                                                                                  |

## Grounded Skybox

`<CubeEnvironment>` is other than `<Environment>` not able to create a
`GroundedSkybox` instance.
