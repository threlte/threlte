A component that renders its children as children of an object that can exist **anywhere in your Threlte application**.
You can use the prop `id` to render into a `<PortalTarget>`.

<Tip type="tip">
  Although Portals are extremely helpful in certain situations, it can be hard to reason about them
  at times. It's recommended to use them sparingly.
</Tip>

### You might not need `<Portal>`

Some objects such as the [`THREE.DirectionalLightHelper`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/helpers/DirectionalLightHelper)
need to be added to the scene itself to be functional.

In this case, the portal target is easily accessible, and passing the `scene` object to the `<T>` component's [attach](http://localhost:4321/docs/reference/core/t#attach) property can accomplish everything we need.

### Rendering to a `<PortalTarget>`

For more complex cases where it's hard to query the target, using `<Portal>` may be an easier solution.

You can define where a `<Portal>` should render its children by using the component [`<PortalTarget>`](/docs/reference/extras/portal-target).
