A mesh of a curved plane designed to look like a studio backdrop. Its intent is to break up light and shadows in more interesting ways.

<Example path="extras/backdrop" />

Children are "slotted" into the underlying mesh so you can set the material of the backdrop like so:

```svelte
<Backdrop>
  <T.MeshStandardMaterial color="#ffffdd" />
</Backdrop>
```

## Props

`floor` controls the length of the "floor" segment of the geometry. The higher the value, the longer the segment.

`receiveShadow` controls whether the mesh receives shadows or not.

`segments` controls the resolution of the mesh.

<Tip type="warning">
  Be aware that updating the `segments` prop causes the geometry to be rebuilt. It's advised not to
  update `segments` in hot-code paths such as [`useTask()`](/docs/reference/core/use-task).
</Tip>
