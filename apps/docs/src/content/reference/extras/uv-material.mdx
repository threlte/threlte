A material that visualizes the uvs of a geometry. Uvs are typically used for texture indexing.

<Example path="extras/uv-material" />

## Caveats

The geometry must have a "uv" attribute in order for this material to work. If you're creating your own geometry, be sure to assign the "uv" attribute.

```ts
const geometry = new BufferGeometry()
const uvAttribute = new BufferAttribute(/* uv array here */)
geometry.setAttribute('uv', uvAttribute)
```

Most models that you import into your program should come with uv data baked in and three.js will automatically assign uv attributes when loading the model.
