The component `<Suspense>` allows you to orchestrate the loading of resources
inside (nested) child components. The implementation roughly follows a subset of the concept
established by the [React Suspense
API](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) and has certain limitations.

The idea is to allow a parent component to make decisions based on the _loading
state_ of child components. The parent component can then decide to show a loading
indicator or a fallback component while the child component is loading.

<Example path="extras/suspense" />

## Usage

### In a child component

Let's have a look at a simple component that loads a model with the hook `useGltf`.

```svelte title="Model.svelte"
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { useGltf } from '@threlte/extras'

  const gltf = useGltf('model.gltf')
</script>

{#await gltf then { scene }}
  <T is={scene}>
{/await}
```

We can make that component _suspense-ready_ by using the hook `useSuspense` and passing the promise returned by `useGltf` to it.

```svelte {3,6}m {5}+ title="Model.svelte"
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { useGltf, useSuspense } from '@threlte/extras'

  const suspend = useSuspense()
  const gltf = suspend(useGltf('model.gltf'))
</script>

{#await gltf then { scene }}
  <T is={scene}>
{/await}
```

<Tip type="tip" title="Suspense-ready">
  *Suspense-ready* means it has the ability to hit a `<Suspense>` boundary if there is any. If there's no `<Suspense>` boundary, the component will behave as usual.
</Tip>

### In a parent component

Now we implement the component "Model.svelte" in a parent component:

```svelte title="Parent.svelte"
<script>
  import Model from './Model.svelte'
</script>

<Model />
```

To let the parent component decide what to do while the model component is loading, we wrap the child component in a `<Suspense>` component and show a fallback component while the child component is loading.

```svelte {3,4,7,8,10}+ title="Parent.svelte"
<script>
  import Model from './Model.svelte'
  import Fallback from './Fallback.svelte'
  import { Suspense } from '@threlte/extras'
</script>

<Suspense>
  <Fallback slot="fallback" />
  <Model />
</Suspense>
```

<Tip type="tip" title="Error Boundary">
  In contrast to the React Suspense API, the `<Suspense>` component also acts as an
  error boundary for async requests	made in child components wrapped in `suspend`.

    The `"error"` snippet will be mounted as soon as an error is thrown in a child component
    wrapped in `suspend` and the snippet prop `errors` can be used to display a meaningful
    error message.

</Tip>

## UX considerations

The `<Suspense>` component is a great tool to improve the user experience of your application. However, it is important to consider the following points:

1. The `<Suspense>` component will only ever show one of the available slots at any time:

- The snippet `"error"` will be shown as soon as an error is thrown.
- The snippet `"fallback"` will be shown as long as a child component is suspended.
- The default slot will be shown as long as no child component is suspended and no error has been thrown.

2. Umounting a component that suspends rendering through awaiting a resource or throwing an error will discard its suspend state.
3. Directly citing the [React Suspense API](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense#revealing-nested-content-as-it-loads):
   > Don't put a Suspense boundary around every component. Suspense boundaries should not be more granular than the loading sequence that you want the user to experience.
4. A `<Suspense>` component can be re-suspended if a child component invokes `suspend` again. The property `final` on the component `<Suspense>` can be used to prevent this behavior.

## Limitations

1. It's important to keep in mind that while the contents of the default slot are not visible, they
   are still mounted and the component is otherwise fully functional. This means that any side
   effects (for instance `useTask` hooks) that are invoked in a _suspense-ready_ child component will be
   executed immediately.

```svelte title="Model.svelte"
<script>
  import { T, useTask } from '@threlte/core'
  import { useGltf, useSuspense } from '@threlte/extras'

  const suspend = useSuspense()
  const gltf = suspend(useGltf('model.gltf'))

  useTask(() => {
    // This will be executed immediately
  })
</script>

{#await gltf then { scene }}
  <T is={scene}>
{/await}
```

2. Also, in contrast to the React Suspense API, the `<Suspense>` component does not support showing a stale
   version of a child component while it is loading.
