A wrapper around three's [CubeCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/cameras/CubeCamera) that exposes a `renderTarget` prop. Before rendering to the render target, children are set to invisible to exclude them from the render.

<Example path="extras/cube-camera" />

## Usage

The entire render target that is used by the underlying cube camera is available through the `renderTarget` snippet prop. Usually you'll only want to use the `renderTarget.texture`.

```svelte
<CubeCamera>
  {#snippet children({ renderTarget })}
    <T.Mesh>
      <T.SphereGeometry />
      <T.MeshStandardMaterial envMap={renderTarget.texture} />
    </T.Mesh>
  {/snippet}
</CubeCamera>
```

### Other Snippet Props

The `children` snippet also has access to the cube camera and a `restart` function. Note that updates to the camera, render target or `ref` inside the snippet block will not be reflected on the render target unless `frames` is set to `Infinity` or you use the `restart` function. Calling `restart` will force the renderer to render to the render target.

```svelte
{#snippet children({ camera, ref, renderTarget, restart })}
  <!-- may need to call `restart` here if updating any of the props above -->
{/snippet}
```

## Controlling Render Count

By default, `frames` is set to `Infinity` which means the scene is rendered to the render target every frame. This is sometimes unnecessary especially if you have a static scene. To improve performance, you can use the `frames` prop to control how many times the scene should be rendered.

For moving objects, let `frames` default to `Infinity`. If you have a static scene, set `frames` equal to the number of `<CubeCamera>`s in the scene. This will allow each one to render and then be picked up in each other's reflection.

## Scene Props

`<CubeCamera>` accepts a `background` prop that can be used to set the background of the scene when rendering to the render target. By default the current `scene.background` is used. `background` can be any valid [Scene.background](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/scenes/Scene.background).

```svelte
<script>
  import { Color } from 'three'

  const background = new Color(0xff_00_ff)
</script>

<CubeCamera {background}>
  <!-- ... -->
</CubeCamera>
```

The `fog` prop is used the same way and accepts any valid [scene.fog](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/scenes/Scene.fog). By default `scene.fog` is used.

These "scene" props are only used when rendering the scene to the underlying render target. After rendering to the target, the original scene props are restored.

## Callback Props

The `onrenderstart` callback prop is called anytime the underlying render task has been started. This means that it also fires anytime the renderer has been restarted manually through the `restart` component export.

```svelte
<script>
  const onrenderstart = () => {
    console.log('render started')
  }

  let ref
  // `onrenderstart` will be fired if `ref.restart` is called
</script>

<CubeCamera
  bind:ref
  onrenderstart
>
  <!-- ... -->
</CubeCamera>
```

`onrenderstart` also fires if you use the `restart` children snippet prop

```svelte
<CubeCamera onrenderstart>
  {#snippet children({ restart })}
    <T.Mesh oncreate={restart}>
      <!-- ... -->
    </T.Mesh>
  {/snippet}
</CubeCamera>
```

The `onrenderstop` callback fires anytime the render task stops running. It is called on restarts and when the internal counter goes over the `frames` limit. This means that if `frames` is set to `Infinity`, `onrenderstop` is never called.
