A wrapper around three's
[CubeCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/cameras/CubeCamera) that
exposes a `renderTarget` prop. Before rendering to the render target, children
are set to invisible to exclude them from the render.

<Example path="extras/cube-camera" />

## Usage

The entire render target that is used by the underlying cube camera is available
through the `renderTarget` snippet prop. Usually you'll only want to use the
`renderTarget.texture`.

```svelte
<CubeCamera>
  {#snippet children({ renderTarget })}
    <T.Mesh>
      <T.SphereGeometry />
      <T.MeshStandardMaterial envMap={renderTarget.texture} />
    </T.Mesh>
  {/snippet}
</CubeCamera>
```

## Controlling Updates

By default, `frames` is set to `Infinity` which means the scene is rendered to
the render target every frame. This is sometimes unnecessary especially if you
have a static scene. To improve performance, you can use the `frames` prop to
control how many times the scene should be rendered.

For moving objects, let `frames` default to `Infinity`. If you have a static
scene, set `frames` equal to the number of `<CubeCamera>`s in the scene. This
will allow each one to render and then be picked up in each other's reflection.

### Manual Updates

If you want full control over updates, use the `update` function available as a
component export and through the `children` snippet.

<Tip type="warning">
  If you use the `update` function, be sure to set `frames` to `0` to prevent the internal update
  task from starting automatically.
</Tip>

#### As a Component Export

```svelte title="Scene.svelte"
<script>
  let cubeCameraComponent = $state()

  $effect(() => {
    // …
    cubeCameraComponent?.update()
  })
</script>

<CubeCamera
  frames={0}
  bind:this={cubeCameraComponent}
>
  <!-- … -->
</CubeCamera>
```

#### Through Children Snippet

```svelte title="Scene.svelte"
<CubeCamera frames={0}>
  {#snippet children({ update })}
    <T.Mesh oncreate{update}>
      <T.BoxGeometry />
    </T.Mesh>
  {/snippet}
</CubeCamera>
```

### Restarting the Task

If you need to restart the update task, you can do so through the `restart`
component export

```svelte
<script>
  let cubeCameraComponent = $state()

  $effect(() => {
    // dependencies here
    cubeCameraComponent?.restart()
  })
</script>

<CubeCamera
  frames={1}
  bind:this={cubeCameraComponent}
>
  <!-- ... -->
</CubeCamera>
```

`restart` is also available through the `children` snippet.

```svelte
<CubeCamerae frames={1}>
  {#snippet children({ restart })}
    <T.Mesh oncreate={restart}>
      <!-- ... -->
    </T.Mesh>
  {/snippet}
</CubeCamera>
```

## Scene Props

`<CubeCamera>` accepts a `background` prop that can be used to set the
background of the scene when rendering to the render target. By default the
current `scene.background` is used. `background` can be any valid
[Scene.background](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/scenes/Scene.background).

```svelte
<script>
  import { Color } from 'three'

  const background = new Color(0xff_00_ff)
</script>

<CubeCamera {background}>
  <!-- ... -->
</CubeCamera>
```

The `fog` prop is used the same way and accepts any valid
[scene.fog](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/scenes/Scene.fog). By
default `scene.fog` is used.

These "scene" props are only used when rendering the scene to the underlying
render target.

## Callback Props

The `onupdatestart` callback prop is called anytime the underlying update task
has been started.

```svelte
<CubeCamera
  onupdatestart={() => {
    console.log('update started')
  }}
>
  <!-- ... -->
</CubeCamera>
```

The `onupdatestop` callback fires anytime the update task has stopped. It is
called on restarts and when the internal counter goes over the `frames` limit.
This means that if `frames` is set to `Infinity`, as it is by default,
`onupdatestop` is never called.
