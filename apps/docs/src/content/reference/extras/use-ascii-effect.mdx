A hook that can be used to give a scene an asciiEffect. It is essentially a wrapper around the `AsciiEffect` addon from three/addons that hooks into some of threlte's context for ease of use.

<Example path="extras/use-ascii-effect" />

## Usage

```ts
const asciiEffect = useAsciiEffect()

const camera = new PespectiveCamera()
const scene = new Sceneiee()

asciiEffect.current.render(scene, camera)
```

If you want to render with threlte's main scene and main camera, you can pull those from the `useThrelte` hoox

```ts
import { useThrelte } from '@threlte/core'

const { camera, scene } = useThrelte()

const asciiEffect = useAsciiEffect()

asciiEffect.current.render(scene, camera.current)
```

## Parameters

`useAsciiEffect` accepts an object of getters to various parameters. These parameters are detailed below.

| name    | description                                                                                                                    |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| charSet | should return the characters to use. used in the derived AsciiEffect's constructor. should be sorted by ascending "opaqueness" |
| options | should return the `AsciiEffectOptions` to use. used in the derived AsciiEffect's constructor                                   |

These are all getters because they are read in `$effects` and `$derived`s in the body of `useAsciiRenderer` function.

### Options

The AsciiEffect addon doesn't support modifying props after creation. For this reason a new AsciiEffect instance is derived any time an options prop updates. Each options prop is detailed below.

| name       | description                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| alpha      | whether to consider alpha when determinging the color of the character. if your scene uses alpha, set this to true     |
| color      | whether to use the "true" color of the scene. may slow down performance especially at higher resolutions               |
| block      | whether to use color blocks when `options.color` is set to true                                                        |
| invert     | uses the more "opaque" characters for darker parts of the scene. brighter parts get mapped to less "opaque" characters |
| resolution | more or less detail in the render                                                                                      |
| scale      | scales the characters. isn't effected by any camera properties                                                         |

```ts
// use block coloring and an inverted character set
useAsciiEffect({
	options: () => {
		color: true,
		invert: true
	}
})
```
