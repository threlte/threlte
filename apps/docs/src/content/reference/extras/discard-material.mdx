`<MeshDiscardMaterial>` is a material that renders nothing. It does so by discarding everything in the fragment shader. The difference between `<T.Mesh visible={false} />` and `<MeshDiscardMaterial>` is that shadows and children are still visible when using `<MeshDiscardMaterial>`.

<Example path="extras/mesh-discard-material" />

In the example above, the visible mesh does not use `<MeshDiscardMaterial>` nor sets `visible={false}`. The center mesh sets `visible={false}`. Notice how its shadow is missing. The final mesh uses `<MeshDiscardMaterial>` and its shadow is visible even though the mesh itself isn't.
