This is a port of [drei's `<View/>`
component](https://drei.docs.pmnd.rs/portals/view). It is used to display
multiple scenes using only one canvas and one renderer. Our implemenation
re-uses parts of the main context but creates new camera, scene, parent, DOM,
cache and user contexts. This ensures you can use Threlte's other components as
per normal.

The following example is equivalent to three.js's [multiple elements
example](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_multiple_elements).

<Example path="extras/view" />

Under the hood, this component uses the renderer's [scissor-cut
method](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/renderers/WebGLRenderer.setScissor).
[Three.js has documentation](https://threejs.org/manual/#en/multiple-scenes) for
when using scissor-cuts as the styling of your canvas has different effects on
the renderering. You access the `canvas` to switch between the options via the
`useThrelte` hook.
