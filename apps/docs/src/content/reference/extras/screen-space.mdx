A component that copies the current camera position and quaternion values into a group every frame. This is useful if you have objects that are always a fixed distance from the camera and have a static rotation no matter how the camera is positioned or oriented.

<Example path="extras/screen-space" />

In the scene above, it may look like the middle mesh is placed in world space but it is actually positioned relative to the camera using `<ScreenSpace>`. No matter how you manipulate the camera, its position and rotation are relative to the camera are constant.

## Bring Your Own Camera

By default, the scene's active camera will be used. You may provide a different camera through the `camera` prop. The `camera` prop is reactive so you can position children relative to any camera at any time.

```svelte
<script>
  import { PerspectiveCamera } from 'three'

  const otherCamera = new PerspectiveCamera()
</script>

<ScreenSize camera={otherCamera}>
  <!-- ... -->
</ScreenSize>
```
