This component is a declarative implementation of the popular [camera-controls](https://github.com/yomotsu/camera-controls) library.

<Example path="extras/camera-controls" />

If the controls are set as a child component of a camera, they will attach to that camera.

```svelte
<T.PerspectiveCamera makeDefault>
  <CameraControls />
</T.PerspectiveCamera>
```

A camera can also optionally be passed to the controls as a prop.

```svelte
<CameraControls camera={myPerspectiveCamera} />
```

Finally, if the component is created without an attached camera
it will use the scene's default camera as provided by `useThrelte`.

## Examples

### Basic Example

```svelte title="CameraControls.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  import { CameraControls, type CameraControlsRef } from '@threlte/extras'

  let controls = $state<CameraControlsRef>()

  $effect.pre(() => {
    controls?.truck(1, 0, true)
  })
</script>

<CameraControls
  bind:ref={controls}
  oncreate={(ref) => ref.setPosition(5, 5, 5)}
/>
```

### Prevent SSR Externalization

If you are using SvelteKit or Vite for building your app, you may need to externalize the `camera-controls` library.

To externalize the `camera-controls` library put the following in your `vite.config.js` or `vite.config.ts`.

```typescript {4-6}+
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [sveltekit()],
  ssr: {
    noExternal: ['camera-controls']
  }
})
```

  The camera-controls package features include first-person, third-person, pointer-lock,
  fit-to-bounding-sphere and much more!
