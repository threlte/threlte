[Rapier](https://rapier.rs/) is a fast physics engine written in Rust. This package provides easy to use components and hooks to use the Rapier physics engine in Threlte.

To start off, it's best to get yourself comfortable with the [basic concepts of rapier](https://rapier.rs/docs/).

<Tip type="experimental">
  This package is under heavy development and its API is subject to change. Also be aware that
  currently only one Rapier-enabled Threlte instance is possible.
