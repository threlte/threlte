<Tip type="warning">
  This component is mostly used internally. It makes certain aspects of three.js objects accessible
  and reactive and interact with Threlte systems. It's an advanced feature and you should only use
  it if you know what you're doing.
</Tip>

On initialization, the component `<HierarchicalObject>` forwards a provided `THREE.Object3D` to a parent `<HierarchicalObject>` component. The parent `<HierarchicalObject>` receives this object in the callback `onChildMount` to e.g. add the object to the scene graph, create a list of all child objects or use the child objects and act on their geometries.

The component [`<SceneGraphObject>`](/docs/reference/core/scene-graph-object) in turn uses this component to add and remove objects to and from the scene graph.

### Basic Example

In this example the component is responsible for

- forwarding the mesh to the parent `<HierarchicalObject>`
- adding children to the scene graph (i.e. as children to the mesh)
- removing children from the scene graph

### Mounting a component to a different parent

Sometimes you need to add a component as a child to another object than its parent. Let's say we want to transform a `THREE.Mesh` object with `TransformControls`. In this case, Three.js wants you to mount the `TransformControls` as a child to the `scene` and `attach` it to the `THREE.Mesh`. We can use the `<HierarchicalObject>` component to add an object to an arbitrary parent object:

```svelte
<script>
  import { HierarchicalObject, useThrelte } from '@threlte/core'
  import { TransformControls } from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/TransformControls.js'
  import { otherMesh } from '$stores/app' // let's say this is a store with a mesh

  const { scene } = useThrelte()
</script>

<HierarchicalObject
  onChildMount={(child) => {
    // child is the TransformControls object
    scene.add(child)
  }}
  onChildDestroy={(child) => {
    // child is the TransformControls object
    scene.remove(child)
  }}
>
  <T
    is={TransformControls}
    oncreate={({ ref, cleanup }) => {
      ref.attach($otherMesh)
      cleanup(ref.detach)
    }}
  />
</HierarchicalObject>
```
