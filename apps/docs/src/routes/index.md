Hooks that make use of the context (as does [useFrame](/core/use-frame) in this example) need to be nested in a child component to `<Canvas>`.

It's inspired by the sensible defaults of [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), the simplicity and effectiveness of Sveltes reactivity model and [Svelte Cubed](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/svelte-cubed).

It provides strictly typed components to quickly and easily build three.js scenes with deep reactivity and interactivity out-of-the-box.

It also aims to provide the building blocks to quickly extend Threlte when it's needed.

:::admonition type="note"
Threlte is still in active development and you should expect breaking changes. Check the release notes before updating. If you want to be on the safe side, install Threlte with `npm i @threlte/core --save-exact` to lock the versions, same goes for `@threlte/extras` and `@threlte/rapier`
