Threlte is a renderer and component library for using Three.js in a **declarative** and **state-driven** way in Svelte apps. It provides strictly typed components for deep **reactivity** and **interactivity** out-of-the-box.

Threlte is comprised of six distinct packages to allow you to import only what you need:

- [@threlte/core](/docs/reference/core/getting-started) is the heart of Threlte, providing simple transparent Svelte binding to Three.js:

  - [`<T>`](/docs/reference/core/t) is the **main building block** of any Threlte application. It is a thin wrapper around any Three.js
    object and provides a declarative API to build and render your Threlte app.

  - [Plugins](/docs/learn/advanced/plugins) make it easy to extend Threlte with custom code and logic. Whether you want to implement an ECS or add a single property to every instance of `<T>`, plugins are the way to go.

- [@threlte/extras](/docs/reference/extras/getting-started) is a collection of plugins and components that extend Threlte with additional functionality.

- [@threlte/gltf](/docs/reference/gltf/getting-started) is a command-line tool that turns GLTF assets into declarative and re-usable Threlte components.

- [@threlte/rapier](/docs/reference/rapier/getting-started) provides components to enable performant physics in your Threlte application through the [Rapier engine](https://rapier.rs/)

- [@threlte/theatre](/docs/reference/theatre/getting-started) provides components to enable animations in your Threlte application through the [Theatre.js animation library](https://www.theatrejs.com/)

- [@threlte/xr](/docs/reference/xr/getting-started) provides components for VR and AR.

- [@threlte/flex](/docs/reference/flex/getting-started) provides components to easily use the flex engine [`yoga-layout`](https://yogalayout.com/) with Threlte.
