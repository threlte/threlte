Threlte makes heavy use of [Svelte's Context
API](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/context-api) as a way to pass data through the
component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level:

```svelte title="SomeComponent.svelte"
<script>
  const { camera, renderer } = useThrelte()
</script>
```

To let Threlte do its magic, we recommend to follow our best practices for
structuring your app.

## Recommended App Structure

The [`<Canvas>`](/docs/reference/core/canvas) component provides all basic contexts in a Threlte application.
The recommended app structure is to have a single child component of `<Canvas>` (typically named "Scene.svelte" in examples) for
your Threlte app. This will allow contexts provided by `useThrelte` and other hooks to be used.

```svelte title="App.svelte"
<script>
  import { Canvas } from '@threlte/core'
  import Scene from './Scene.svelte'
</script>

<Canvas>
  <Scene />
</Canvas>
```

```svelte title="Scene.svelte"
<script>
  import { T, useTask } from '@threlte/core'
  import { interactivity } from '@threlte/extras'
  import Player from './Player.svelte'
  import World from './World.svelte'

  let rotation = 0

  // useTask is relying on a context provided
  // by <Canvas>. Because we are definitely *inside*
  // <Canvas>, we can safely use it.
  useTask((delta) => {
    rotation += delta
  })

  // This file is also typically the place to
  // inject plugins
  interactivity()
</script>

<T.Mesh rotation.y={rotation}>
  <T.BoxGeometry />
  <T.MeshBasicMaterial color="red" />
</T.Mesh>

<Player />
<World />
```

## Context Not Available

<Tip type="danger">
	The following app structure is deceiving. It looks like it should work, but **it
	will not**. The problem is that the `useTask` hook is called *outside* of the
	`<Canvas>` component, so the main Threlte context is not available. Usually hooks
	relying on some context will tell you with descriptive error messages when they
	are used outside of their context.
</Tip>

```svelte title="App.svelte"
<script>
  import { Canvas, useTask, T } from '@threlte/core'

  let rotation = 0

  // This won't work, we're not inside <Canvas>
  useTask((delta) => {
    rotation += delta
  })
</script>

<Canvas>
  <T.Mesh rotation.y={rotation} />
</Canvas>
```
