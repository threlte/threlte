The hook `useSuspense` is used to mark a resource as being used in a
`<Suspense>` boundary or to get the `suspended`-state of the closest
`<Suspense>` boundary. For a complete implementation example, have a look at the
[`<Suspense>` component](/docs/reference/extras/suspense).

## Usage

### Mark as Async Resource

The hook returns a function that allows you to mark a resource as being used in
a `<Suspense>` boundary. To suspend the closest `<Suspense>` boundary, call the
function returned by `useSuspense()` and pass a promise as the first argument.
Because [`useLoader().load()`](/docs/reference/core/use-loader) returns an
[`AsyncWritable`](/docs/reference/core/utilities#asyncwritable), the result of
`useLoader().load()` can be passed directly to the function returned by
`useSuspense()`.

```ts
const suspend = useSuspense()
suspend(useTexture('/texture.png'))
```

### Get Suspended State

The hook can be used to get the `suspended`-state of the closest `<Suspense>` boundary.

```ts
const { suspended } = useSuspense()
$: console.log($suspended)
```
