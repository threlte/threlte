The `<CSM/>` component offers a streamlined convenience integration of the Cascaded Shadow Maps technique, sourced from the Three.js addon.

<Example path="extras/csm" />

Cascaded Shadow Maps (CSM) are a technique employed to render shadows with varying levels of
detail based on their distance from the camera. CSMs utilize multiple shadow maps to produce
higher resolution shadows closer to the camera and gradually decrease this resolution for
shadows farther away. This method is especially beneficial when rendering sun-cast
shadows over vast terrains, ensuring detailed and performance-optimized shadow renderings.

## Usage

```svelte title="Scene.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  import { CSM } from '@threlte/extras'
  import { Vector3 } from 'three'
</script>

<CSM
  enabled
  args={{
    lightDirection: new Vector3(1, -1, 1).normalize()
  }}
>
  <!-- Your scene goes here -->
</CSM>
```

For CSM to work, shadow maps must be enabled. Threlte does this by default. **Do not disable shadowmaps** by [`<Canvas shadows={false}>`](/docs/reference/core/canvas#component-signature).

Then, wrap all of the objects that you wish to use CSM on (typically your entire scene) with the `<CSM>` component.

Internally, the `<CSM>` component modifies the shader code of all materials inside the component.
Currently, support is limited only to `THREE.MeshStandardMaterial` and `THREE.MeshPhongMaterial`.

<Tip type="warning">Setting `castShadow` property on any lights in a scene with `<CSM>` enabled leads to crashes.</Tip>

## CSM Parameters

The `<CSM>` component exposes an optional `args` prop which is used to instantiate the class `CSM`. These arguments are not reactive and are only updated when CSM is enabled.

For implementation details, refer to [the Three.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/jsm/csm/CSM.js).

## Custom configuration

The `<CSM>` component offers a configuration callback, which is called when CSM is activated.
This callback facilitates advanced configurations, such as enabling the fade feature.

```svelte title="Scene.svelte"
<CSM
  configure={(csm) => {
    // advanced CSM configuration can be handle here.
    csm.fade = true
  }}
>
  <!-- Your scene goes here -->
</CSM>
```

<Tip type="tip">
  With fade enabled, shadows subtly diminish close to `maxFar` distance, presenting a more aesthetic
  transition compared to an abrupt cut-off. It may be more visually pleasing, but it's important to
  consider potential performance implications. While typically minimal, the computational complexity
  can escalate based on the number of cascades and lights present in the scene. Fade is disabled by
  default.
</Tip>

## Providing a fallback

You may want to use a regular `<T.DirectionalLight>` when CSM is not enabled,
for instance if you are developing a game and want to support low-end devices by
disabling shadows altogehter. You can do this by using the `enabled` prop and
the `disabled` slot:

```svelte title="Scene.svelte"
<CSM enabled={settings.shadows}>
  <!-- Your scene goes here -->

  <slot name="disabled">
    <!-- Will be mounted if settings.shadows is false -->
    <T.DirectionalLight castShadow={false} />
  </slot>
</CSM>
```
