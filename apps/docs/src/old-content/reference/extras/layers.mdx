`layers` is a plugin that provides inheritance for the property `layers` on `<T>` components.
Typically when assigning a value to `layers` on a `<T>` component, it will only be applied to that component.
This plugin allows you to assign a value to `layers` on a parent component and have it be inherited by all child components.

<Tip type="tip">
  This plugin injects and relies on a context. It's affecting all `<T>` components that are
	descendants of the component that uses it. Check out the [guide on structuring your
  app](/docs/learn/basics/app-structure) to learn more about contexts.

## Usage

```svelte title="Scene.svelte" {2,3}+
<script>
  import { layers } from '@threlte/extras'
  layers()
</script>

<!--
The camera needs to be on the same layer
as an object for the object to be visible
-->
<T.PerspectiveCamera layers={[4, 5]} />

<!--
Everything inside this group that isn't
assigned another layer is on layer 4 and
is therefore visible to the camera
-->
<T.Group layers={4}>
  <T.Mesh>
    <T.BoxGeometry />
    <T.MeshStandardMaterial />
  </T.Mesh>

  <!-- This Mesh is on all layers -->
  <T.Mesh layers={'all'}>
    <T.BoxGeometry />
    <T.MeshStandardMaterial />
  </T.Mesh>
</T.Group>
```
