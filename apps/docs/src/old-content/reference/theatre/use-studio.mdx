The `useStudio` hook allows you to access the Theatre.js studio object.

## Usage

Unlike most Threlte hooks, this is _not_ a context hook, which means it can be used anywhere in your app.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { useStudio } from '@threlte/theatre'
  const studio = useStudio()
</script>
```
