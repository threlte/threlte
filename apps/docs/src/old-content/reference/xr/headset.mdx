`<Headset />` provides the ability to attach objects to the pose of the user's headset.

```svelte
<script>
  import { Headset } from '@threlte/xr'
  import { AudioListener } from '@threlte/extras'
</script>

<Headset>
  <AudioListener />
</Headset>
```

If you need to only read from the current headset pose, the [useHeadset](/docs/reference/xr/use-headset) hook is available.

Like a [Portal](/docs/reference/extras/portal), you can place it anywhere in your Threlte application.

`<Headset>` will sync position and rotation with the current camera when not in an immersive XR session.
