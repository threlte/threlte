The hook `useDimensions` can be used to retrieve the _computed_ width and
height of a `<Flex>` or `<Box>` component as
[CurrentWritable](https://threlte.xyz/docs/reference/core/utilities#currentwritable)
stores.

<Tip type="tip">
	The computed width and height is also available as slot props
	on the components [`<Flex>`](/docs/reference/flex/flex#content-dimensions) and
	[`<Box>`](/docs/reference/flex/box#content-sizing).
</Tip>

## In a `<Flex>` component

Because there's no viewport to measure, the width and height of a `<Flex>`
component need to be set manually. Nevertheless, the dimensions of the
contents of the `<Flex>` component will be measured after a layout reflow and
can be retrieved using `useDimensions` in a direct child component to
`<Flex>`.

## In a `<Box>` component

The `<Box>` component controls element positions only. However, if you wish to
handle element dimensions based on the layout calculated by Yoga, you'll need to
manually adapt the content's size. This is because `@threlte/flex` lacks
knowledge about the inner content's sizing mechanisms. You can do this by using
`useDimensions` hook in a direct child component to `<Box>`.

```svelte title="Parent.svelte"
<script>
  import { Flex, Box } from '@threlte/flex'
  import Model from './Model.svelte'
</script>

<Flex
  width={100}
  height={100}
  justifyContent="Center"
  alignItems="Stretch"
>
  <Box
    width="auto"
    height="auto"
    flex={1}
  >
    <Model />
  </Box>
</Flex>
```

```svelte title="Model.svelte"
<script>
  import { useDimensions } from '@threlte/flex'

  const { width, height } = useDimensions()
</script>

<T.Mesh
  scale.x={$width}
  scale.y={$height}
>
  <T.BoxGeometry />
  <T.MeshBasicMaterial color="red" />
</T.Mesh>
```
