An attractor simulates a source of gravity. Any rigid-body within range will be "pulled" toward the attractor's center.

The force applied to rigid-bodies within range is calculated differently, depending on the `gravityType`.

## Basic Example

<Example path="rapier/attractor" />

## Gravity Types

### Static (Default)

Static gravity means that the same force (`strength`) is applied on all rigid-bodies within range, regardless of distance.

### Linear

Linear gravity means that force is calculated as `strength * distance / range`. That means the force applied increases as a rigid-body moves closer to the attractor's center.

### Newtonian

Newtonian gravity uses the traditional method of calculating gravitational force (`F = GMm/r^2`) and as such force is calculated as `gravitationalConstant * mass1 * mass2 / Math.pow(distance, 2)`.

- `gravitationalConstant` defaults to 6.673e-11 but you can provide your own
- `mass1` here is the "mass" of the Attractor, which is just the `strength` property
- `mass2` is the mass of the rigid-body at the time of calculation. Note that rigid-bodies with colliders will use the mass provided to the collider. This is not a value you can control from the attractor, only from wherever you're creating rigid-body components in the scene.
- `distance` is the distance between the attractor and rigid-body at the time of calculation

## Debugging

The `<Debug />` component will activate a wireframe helper to visualize the attractor's range.
