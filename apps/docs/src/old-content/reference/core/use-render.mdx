<Tip type="danger">
	This hook is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.
	Please use [`useTask`](/docs/reference/core/use-task) instead. See the [migration guide](/docs/learn/advanced/migration-guides#migrating-from-useframe-and-userender-to-the-task-scheduling-system) for more information.
</Tip>

This hook allows you to execute code on every **invalidated** frame and after all `useFrame` hooks have been executed.
You receive the state (the same as [`useThrelte`](/docs/reference/core/use-threlte)) and a clock delta in seconds.
Typically this hook is used to implement advanced rendering techniques such as post processing or custom render passes.

<Tip type="warning">
  As soon as this hook is used anywhere in the component tree, the default render loop is disabled.
  You need to take care of rendering yourself.
</Tip>

You may pass additional options to this hook. The property `order` is useful if you need to order the sequence of `useRender` callbacks across the component tree where callbacks are ordered from low to high.

```ts
type ThrelteUseRenderOptions = {
  order?: number
}
```

### Basic Rendering

```svelte title="Renderer.svelte"
<script>
  import { useRender } from '@threlte/core'

  useRender(({ camera, renderer, scene }, delta) => {
    renderer.render(scene, camera.current)
  })
</script>
```

<Tip type="tip">
  The state available in the callback is the same as the one available with <code>useThrelte</code>.
  Some properties (such as the property `camera`) use a `CurrentWritable` store. which is a custom
  Threlte store. It's a regular writable store that also has a `current` property which is the
  current value of the store. It's useful for accessing the value of a store in a non-reactive
  context, such as in loops.
</Tip>

### Post Processing

This example demonstrates how to use `useRender` to implement post processing
effects using the library
[`postprocessing`](https://github.com/pmndrs/postprocessing).

<Tip type="warning">
  When using SvelteKit (or more broadly, SSR) be sure to add `ssr: { noExternal: [ 'postprocessing' ] }` to your `vite.config.js`.
</Tip>

```svelte title="Renderer.svelte"
<script>
  import { useThrelte, useRender } from '@threlte/core'
  import {
    EffectComposer,
    EffectPass,
    RenderPass,
    SMAAEffect,
    SMAAPreset,
    BloomEffect,
    KernelSize
  } from 'postprocessing'

  const { scene, renderer, camera, size } = useThrelte()

  // To use the EffectComposer we need to pass arguments to the
  // default WebGLRenderer: https://github.com/pmndrs/postprocessing#usage
  const composer = new EffectComposer(renderer)

  const setupEffectComposer = (camera) => {
    composer.removeAllPasses()
    composer.addPass(new RenderPass(scene, camera))
    composer.addPass(
      new EffectPass(
        camera,
        new BloomEffect({
          intensity: 1,
          luminanceThreshold: 0.15,
          height: 512,
          width: 512,
          luminanceSmoothing: 0.08,
          mipmapBlur: true,
          kernelSize: KernelSize.MEDIUM
        })
      )
    )
    composer.addPass(
      new EffectPass(
        camera,
        new SMAAEffect({
          preset: SMAAPreset.LOW
        })
      )
    )
  }

  // We need to set up the passes according to the camera in use
  $: setupEffectComposer($camera)
  $: composer.setSize($size.width, $size.height)

  useRender((_, delta) => {
    composer.render(delta)
  })
</script>
```
