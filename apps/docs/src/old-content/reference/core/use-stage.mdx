<Tip type="info">
  Tasks are part of Threlte's *Task Scheduling System*.
  For details on how to use stages and tasks, see the [scheduling
  tasks](/docs/learn/basics/scheduling-tasks) page.
</Tip>

The hook `useStage` can be used to create or retrieve a stage.
Stages are **groups of tasks**. They are executed in a specific order.

## Creating a Stage

`useStage` will create a stage if it does not exist yet, or return the existing
stage if it does.

```ts
const { renderStage } = useThrelte()

// All tasks added to the stage `afterRenderStage`
// will be executed after the tasks of the stage `renderStage`.
const afterRenderStage = useStage('after-render', {
  after: renderStage
})
```

<Tip type="tip">
  Be aware that `useStage` never removes a stage as that's usually not needed. If a stage
  is created *once* in your Threlte app, it's available throughout the app's lifetime. If
  you want to remove a stage, you can do so by calling `removeStage` on the scheduler instance
  returned by `useThrelte`.
</Tip>

A stage decides **when and how its tasks are executed**. By default, a stage will
execute its tasks on every frame. You can change this behavior by passing a
`callback` option to `useStage`. This callback will be called every frame. The
first argument `delta` is the time elapsed since the last frame. The second
argument `runTasks` is a function that when invoked will run all the tasks of
the stage in their respective order. You can use it to run the tasks only when
needed (e.g. when a condition is met) or to run them multiple times. If a number
is passed as the first argument to runTasks, the tasks will receive that as the
delta.

```ts
const { renderStage } = useThrelte()

const conditionalStage = useStage('after-render', {
  after: renderStage,
  callback: (delta, runTasks) => {
      // This callback will be called every frame. The first argument is the time elapsed
      // since the last frame. The second argument is a function that will run all the
      // tasks of the stage. You can use it to run the tasks only when needed (e.g. when
      // a condition is met) or to run them multiple times. If a number is passed as the
      // first argument to runTasks, the tasks will receive that as the delta.
      if (condition) {
        runTasks()
      }
    }
})
```

## Examples

### Implement Performance Profiling

This component will implement
[three-perf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three-perf). It expects you to call a
function `perf.begin()` before any frame callbacks are executed and `perf.end()`
after all frame callbacks have been executed, including rendering. Assuming our
app didn't add any other stages, we add a stage that runs before Threlte's
[`mainStage`](/docs/learn/basics/scheduling-tasks#default-stages) (making it the
first stage) and another stage that runs after Threlte's
[`renderStage`](/docs/learn/basics/scheduling-tasks#default-stages) (making it
the last stage). We then call `perf.begin()` in a task of the first stage and
`perf.end()` in a task of the second stage.

```svelte title="ThreePerf.svelte"
<script>
  import { useStage, useTask, useThrelte } from '@threlte/core'
  import { ThreePerf } from 'three-perf'

  const { renderer, mainStage, renderStage } = useThrelte()

  const perf = new ThreePerf({
    anchorX: 'left',
    anchorY: 'top',
    domElement: document.body,
    renderer
  })

  const beforeMainStage = useStage('three-perf-begin', {
    before: mainStage
  })

  useTask(() => {
    perf.begin()
  }, { stage: beforeMainStage })

  const afterRenderStage = useStage('three-perf-end', {
    after: renderStage
  })

  useTask(() => {
    perf.end()
  }, { stage: afterRenderStage })
</script>
```
