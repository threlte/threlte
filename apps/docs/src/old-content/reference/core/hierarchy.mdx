<Tip type="warning">
  This component is mostly used internally and is not required for most use cases.
</Tip>

To control adding and removing components from the scene graph there's the following component:

- [`<HierarchicalObject>`](/docs/reference/core/hierarchical-object)

A simple extension of the `<HierarchicalObject>` is the [`<SceneGraphObject>`](/docs/reference/core/scene-graph-object).

For most other use cases the [`<Portal>`](/docs/reference/extras/portal) component is what your looking for.
