Plugins are one of Threlte's superpowers. Plugins allow you to globally extend Threlte's [`<T>`](/docs/reference/core/t) component
functionality. This means you can not only add arbitrary props and event handlers to your `<T>` components but also
override the default behavior of the `<T>` component entirely.

Plugins add code to every `<T>` component instance. That code acts as if it were part of the `<T>` component itself.
You have full access to props, event listeners and the component instance itself. For an advanced example of what
a plugin can do, see the [interactivity plugin of `@threlte/extras`](/docs/reference/extras/interactivity).

## `injectPlugin`

The function `injectPlugin` adds a plugin to all descendant `<T>` components of the component that
invokes it. This means that you can add plugins to a specific part of your scene graph without
affecting the rest of the scene graph.

```ts
import { injectPlugin } from '@threlte/core'

injectPlugin('plugin-name', ({ ref, props }) => {
  // We are *inside* a `<T>` component instance

  // Do something with the ref and props
  // e.g. return early if the plugin is not applicable

  return {
    // These props are reserved for this plugin, the
    // `<T>` component instance will not act on them.
    pluginProps: ['plugin-prop-a', 'plugin-prop-b'],

    // this function is called whenever the `ref` inside the `<T>`
    // component changes. You may return a cleanup function that is
    // called when the ref changes again or the component unmounts.
    onRefChange: (ref) => {
      // Do something with the ref
      return () => {
        // Cleanup
      }
    },

    // This function is called whenever the $$props of the `<T>` component
    // change. These include props like "dispose", "args" and "makeDefault"
    // that are part of the component itself rather than the props that are
    // passed to the Three.js object.
    onPropsChange: (props) => {
      // Do something with the props
    },

    // This function is called whenever the $$restProps of the `<T>` component
    // change. These are the props that are passed to the Three.js object.
    onRestPropsChange: (restProps) => {
      // Do something with the restProps
    }
  }
})
```

You may also override a plugin namespace further down the tree by calling `injectPlugin` again with the same plugin name.

<Tip type="tip">
	`injectPlugin` is relying on a context provided by your root `<Canvas>` component and can therefore only be used inside a `<Canvas>` component.
</Tip>

## `createPlugin`

The function `createPlugin` creates a `NamedPlugin` but does not add it to the global plugin list and therefore does not
make it available to all `<T>` components. This is useful if you want to create a plugin at some place and inject it at another.

```ts title="plugin.ts"
import { createPlugin } from '@threlte/core'

export const plugin = createPlugin('plugin-name', ({ ref, props }) => {
  // Plugin Code
})
```

```svelte title="Component.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  import { injectPlugin } from '@threlte/core'
  import { plugin } from './plugin'

  injectPlugin(plugin)
</script>
```
