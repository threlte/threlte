Transition seamlessly between GLTF animations.

<Example path="animation/transitions" />

## Explanation

glTF is a comprehensive file format for 3D models, and it supports animations.
In this example, we extract the animations from the gltf file, play them, and crossfade between them.

### What is the code doing?

1. Extract the variables `gltf` and `actions`;

   `const { gltf, actions } = useGltfAnimations()`

2. Bind `gltf` to the `<GLTF>` component,

```
<GLTF
  bind:gltf={$gltf}
  url="https://threejs.org/examples/models/gltf/Xbot.glb"
/>
```

this causes `actions` to be populated with an array of the available animations in that gltf file

<Tip type="tip">
  run `console.log(Object.entries($actions))` to see the available action strings, and the shape of
  the animation object. By doing this, you'll discover that this example is only using 3 of the 7
  available animations attached to this gltf file.
</Tip>

3. selecting a different animation calls `transitionTo` function, which crossfades between the two animations
