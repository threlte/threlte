One of the most appealing features of a physics engine is to simulate articulations. Articulations, aka. joints, allow the restriction of the motion of one body relative to another body. For example, one well-known joint is the ball-in-socket joint also known as the spherical joint: it allows one object to rotate freely with regard to the other but not to translate. This is typically used to simulate shoulders of a ragdoll.

To start off, get yourself comfortable with the [basic concepts of Joints](https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/javascript/joints#basic-concepts).

Currently Rapier supports these joints:

- **Fixed joint**
  - [`useFixedJoint` hook](/docs/reference/rapier/use-fixed-joint)
  - [Rapier Documentation](https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/javascript/joints#fixed-joint)
  - [Rapier Reference](https://rapier.rs/javascript3d/classes/FixedImpulseJoint.html)
- **Revolute joint**
  - [`useRevoluteJoint` hook](/docs/reference/rapier/use-revolute-joint)
  - [Rapier Documentation](https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/javascript/joints#revolute-joint)
  - [Rapier Reference](https://rapier.rs/javascript3d/classes/RevoluteImpulseJoint.html)
- **Prismatic joint**
  - [`usePrismaticJoint` hook](/docs/reference/rapier/use-prismatic-joint)
  - [Rapier Documentation](https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/javascript/joints#prismatic-joint)
  - [Rapier Reference](https://rapier.rs/javascript3d/classes/PrismaticImpulseJoint.html)
- **Spherical joint**
  - [`useSphericalJoint` hook](/docs/reference/rapier/use-spherical-joint)
  - [Rapier Documentation](https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/javascript/joints#spherical-joint)
  - [Rapier Reference](https://rapier.rs/javascript3d/classes/SphericalImpulseJoint.html)

### Why hooks?

Joints need two rigid bodies which the joint operates on. These two rigid bodies cannot always be infered from a component tree. See the following example:

```svelte
<script>
  import { RigidBody, Collider } from '@threlte/rapier'
</script>

<!-- A -->
<RigidBody>
  <Collider
    shape="cuboid"
    args={[1, 1, 1]}
  />
</RigidBody>

<!-- B -->
<RigidBody>
  <Collider
    shape="cuboid"
    args={[1, 1, 1]}
  />
</RigidBody>

<!-- C -->
<RigidBody>
  <Collider
    shape="cuboid"
    args={[1, 1, 1]}
  />
</RigidBody>
```

There's no way to wrap `<RigidBody>` **A** and **B** in an imaginary component `<Joint>` as well as to wrap **A** and **C** in a separate component `<Joint>` to generate two joints which both act on `<RigidBody>` **A**.
