A robust grid implementation with multiple tweakable parameters.

<Example path="extras/grid" />

## Usage

This component provides sensible defaults. You can initialize the default grid with just `<Grid>`. `ref` passes a reference from the `<T.Mesh/>` the grid is constructed on.

### Grid types

The grid type can be selected by setting the `type` parameter. The available grid types are:

- `grid`: represents a standard box grid. It does not require any additional properties. (default)
- `lines`: grid consisting of lines that align along a single world axis. You specify this axis by providing either `x`, `y` or `z` to the `axis` property.
- `circular`: grid formed of concentric circles. It includes a `maxRadius` property that sets the maximum growth extent for the grid. A value of `0` removes this limit, allowing the grid to occupy the entire geometry, even if it results in incomplete circles.
- `polar`: similar to the circular type, but it also features lines that subdivide the concentric circles. It too has a `maxRadius` property. Additionally, it has two properties for specifying dividers: `cellDivider` and `sectionDivider`. These determine how many lines will segment the circle into various sectors. For example, 2 lines result in 4 segments at 90° each, while 6 lines create 12 sectors at 30° apiece.

| Grid                                               | Lines                                               | Circular                                               | Polar                                               |

### Cells and Sections

Grid is split into cells and sections. **Cell** is meant to represent the smallest units on your grid, whereas
**section** is a group of cells. You can adjust the size of the grid by changing the `cellSize` and `sectionSize`
parameters. Size is in Three world units, so for example a mesh with `BoxGeometry(1,1,1)` will fit perfectly into
a size 1 cell. By default a cell is 1 unit and a section 10, which means that a grid of 10x10 cells will be
outlined with a section line.

### Lines

You can adjust the color and thickness of cell and section lines with `cellColor`, `cellThickness`, `sectionColor`, `sectionThickness`.

### Grid size and fading

The `<Grid>` component is a `THREE.Mesh` with a `PlaneGeometry` attached to it. The `gridSize` parameter defines the size of the `PlaneGeometry`.
You can extend the grid into infinity if you set the `infiniteGrid` parameter to `true`.
Changing `fadeDistance` sets how far from the camera position the grid begins to fade by having its alpha reduced. `fadeStrength` determines how fast it happens (exponent). `fadeStrength = 0` means that there is no fading (not recommended for large grids).

### Custom geometry

You have the option to insert your own custom geometry into the `<Grid/>` slot. The preceding example demonstrates this by showcasing a preview of a terrain-like geometry generated using Perlin noise.

```svelte
<Grid>
  <T.BoxGeometry />
</Grid>
```

### Follow camera

Setting `followCamera` to true applies a transform that moves the grid to the camera's position on the chosen `plane`.
