Used in combination with [`<MeshLineMaterial>`](/docs/reference/extras/meshline-material) to create a line formed of a strip of billboarded triangles, based on <a href="https://github.com/spite/THREE.MeshLine" target="_blank">THREE.MeshLine</a>.

<Example path="extras/meshline-geometry" />

## Usage

This component works by taking an array of points to form a line geometry without any thickness, which is then projected and expanded in screen space by `<MeshLineMaterial>`.
Both `<MeshLineMaterial>` and `<MeshLineGeometry>` need to be the children of the same parent mesh.

### Example

```svelte
<script>
  const points = [new Vector3(-1, 1, -1), new Vector3(0, 1, 0), new Vector3(1, 1, 1)]
</script>

<T.Mesh>
  <MeshLineGeometry {points} />
  <MeshLineMaterial
    width={0.5}
    color="#fe3d00"
  />
</T.Mesh>
```

### Points

The `points` property is required and accepts an array of `THREE.Vector3` objects.
The `points` property is reactive and you can animate the line by updating the positions of the `Vector3` objects within the array.

<Tip type="warning">
  When updating the <b>points</b> array you must ensure the updated array is the same length as the
  initial array, otherwise the points will not update. In other words you can alter the position of
  points in the array but you cannot add or remove points.
</Tip>

### Shape

By default the line will be a constant thickness along it's length, at a width defined in `<MeshLineMaterial>`.
To create a line that tapers down to a point at each end you can set the `shape` property to `'taper'`.

For more control over the shape of the line you can set the `shape` property to `'custom'` and pass a custom function to the `shapeFunction` property.

The function will define the width at each point along the line, for example `p => 2` will make the line double the width.
The property `p` is the percentage of the number of points, i.e. for point 200 of 250 points, p = 0.8.
For example the following code will define a line that tapers off at one end:

```svelte
<T.Mesh>
  <MeshLineGeometry
    {points}
    shape={'custom'}
    shapeFunction={(p) => 1 - p}
  />
  <MeshLineMaterial />
</T.Mesh>
```
