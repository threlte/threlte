`<TrackballControls>` allow the camera to orbit freely around a target without causing gimbal lock. This type of camera controller is commonly used when the concepts of up and down are less important than the ability to carefully inspect a model from every angle. For an alternative camera controller, see [`<OrbitControls>`](/docs/reference/extras/orbit-controls).

The component `<TrackballControls>` must be a direct child of a camera component and will mount itself to that camera.
By default, damping is enabled. You can disable this by setting `staticMoving` to true.

<Tip type="info">
	Unlike `<OrbitControls>`, `<TrackballControls>` does not support `autoRotate`.

This example shows off just a few of the configurable properties of `<TrackballControls>`. To see all 15+ properties, consult the [Three.js docs](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/TrackballControls).

## Usage

```svelte
<script>
  import { TrackballControls } from '@threlte/extras'
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
</script>

<T.PerspectiveCamera
  makeDefault
  fov={50}
>
  <TrackballControls />
</T.PerspectiveCamera>
```

`<TrackballControls>` is a light wrapper that will use its parent as the target camera and the DOM element
the renderer is rendering to as the DOM element to listen to. It will also by demand invalidate the frame loop.
