The `useSequence` hook allows you to access a sequence's playback controls using a store API.

## Usage

The hook can be used within the [`<Sheet>`](/docs/reference/theatre/sheet) context or withing the [`<Sequence>`](/docs/reference/theatre/sequence) context:

```svelte
<!-- child of a <Sheet> or <Sequence> -->
<script lang="ts">
  import { useSequence } from '@threlte/theatre'
  const { position, playing, length, play, pause, config } = useSequence()
</script>
```

### Example

This example uses the `useSequence` hook to allow you to control the feather's animation using the feather itself. Hover will pause the animation and clicking and dragging the feather up and down allow you to wind back and forth in time.
