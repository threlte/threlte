Threlte comes with a few utilities that are catered towards the use in a Threlte application but can also be used in other projects.

## `watch`

Watch a single store or multiple stores and call a callback when they change to trigger side effects. The callback will be called immediately with the current value of the store.

```ts
const store = writable(0)
watch(store, (value) => {
  console.log(value) // 0
})
```

<Tip type="info">This utility function needs to be called during component initialization.</Tip>

You can also watch multiple stores:

```ts
const store1 = writable(0)
const store2 = writable(1)
watch([store1, store2], ([value1, value2]) => {
  console.log(value1, value2) // 0 1
})
```

The callback can return a cleanup function that will be called when the stores change again.

```ts
const store = writable(0)
watch(store, (value) => {
  console.log(value) // 0
  return () => {
    console.log('cleanup')
  }
})
```

---

## `memoize`

Use a single store or multiple stores and return the value(s) as an object.
This is useful for using stores in a non-reactive way e.g. in loops.

```ts
const numberStore = writable(0)
const memoized = memoize(numberStore) // { current: 0 }

useTask(() => {
  numberStore.update((n) => n + 1)
  console.log(memoized.current) // 1, 2, 3, ...
})

const stringStore = writable('hello')
const memoized = memoize([numberStore, stringStore])
console.log(memoized.current) // [0, 'hello']
```

<Tip type="info">This utility function needs to be called during component initialization.</Tip>

You can also pass a transform function to transform the values:

```ts
const store = writable(0)
const doubled = memoize(store, (n) => n * 2) // { current: 0 }

useTask(() => {
  store.update((n) => n + 1)
  console.log(doubled.current) // 2, 4, 6, ...
})
```

## `asyncWritable`

Creates a writable store that is initialized with a promise. The store also directly
implements the `then` and `catch` methods of the promise so that it can be
used in `await` expressions and `{#await}` blocks of Svelte.

```svelte
<script>
  import { asyncWritable } from '@threlte/core'

  const asyncOperation = async () => {
    // Do something async
  }
  const store = asyncWritable(asyncOperation())
  $: console.log($store) // asyncOperation result
</script>

<h1>
  {#await store then data}
    // Do something with the data
  {/await}
</h1>
```

This type of store is the return type of the [`load` function of `useLoader`](/docs/reference/core/use-loader#loading-an-asset).

If an error occurs in the promise, the error will be logged to the console
and the error can be accessed via the `error` property of the store which is also a store.

```svelte
<script>
  import { asyncWritable } from '@threlte/core'

  const asyncOp = async () => {
    throw new Error('Something went wrong')
  }

  const store = asyncWritable(asyncOp())
  const error = store.error

  $: console.log($store) // undefined
  $: console.log($error) // Error: Something went wrong
</script>
```

---

## `currentWritable`

A writable store that also has a `current` property that is updated synchronously.
For use in non-reactive contexts e.g. loops where unwrapping a store every frame
(with Svelte's `get` method) is expensive.

```ts
const store = currentWritable(0)

useTask(() => {
  console.log(store.current) // 0
})
```

---

## `forwardEventHandlers`

Natively, Svelte has no way of passing down event handlers inside a
component to a child component. Events have to be hand-wired upstream. This
function allows you to forward event handlers from a parent component to a child
component as if they were declared on the child component itself.

```svelte title="Child.svelte"
<script>
  import { forwardEventHandlers } from '@threlte/core'
  const dispatchingComponent = forwardEventHandlers()
</script>

<OtherChildComponent bind:this={$dispatchingComponent} />
```

Now, when implementing `<Child>` and adding event handlers via `on:eventname`,
those event handlers will be forwarded to `<OtherChildComponent>`:

```svelte title="Parent.svelte"
<script>
  import Child from './Child.svelte'
</script>

<Child on:click={() => console.log('clicked')} />
```

If `OtherChildComponent.svelte` now dispatches a `click` event, the event handler
in `Parent.svelte` will be called.

## `createRawEventDispatcher`

This event dispatcher creates raw events unlike Svelte's own event dispatcher
which nests the data in a detail object (`CustomEvent<Payload>`). This is not
nesessary for a lot of Threlte use cases and makes it harder to work with the payload.

```svelte title="ComponentA.svelte"
<script>
  const dispatch = createRawEventDispatcher<{ foo: string }>()
  dispatch('foo', 'bar')
</script>
```

```svelte title="ComponentB.svelte"
<ComponentA on:foo={(e) => console.log(e)} />
<!-- 'bar' -->
```
