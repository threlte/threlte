<Tip type="info">
  Tasks are part of Threlte's *Task Scheduling System*.
  For details on how to use stages and tasks, see the [scheduling
  tasks](/docs/learn/basics/scheduling-tasks) page.
</Tip>

The hook `useTask` is used to create a
[task](/docs/learn/basics/scheduling-tasks#tasks) that is used to run code on
every frame.

## Creating an Anonymous Task

In its most basic form, `useTask` takes a callback function as its argument. This
function will be executed on every frame, starting on the next frame. It receives a `delta`, representing the time since the last frame as its
argument. By default, the created task is added to [Threlte's
`mainStage`](#default-stages) in an arbitrary order (i.e. without dependencies).

```ts
const { start, stop, started, task } = useTask((delta) => {
  // This function will be executed on every frame
})
```

It returns an object with the following properties:
- `start`: A function that starts the task. It will be executed on the next
  frame. Note that by default a task is started automatically.
- `stop`: A function that stops the task. It will not be executed on the next
  frame.
- `started`: A boolean Svelte `Readable` store indicating whether the task is
  started or not.
- `task`: The task itself. You can use it to indicate a dependency to this task
  on another task.

## Creating a Keyed Task

You can *key* a task by passing it as the first argument to `useTask`. This
makes referencing this task easier across your app. The key can be any `string`
or `symbol` value that is unique across all tasks in the stage it is added to.

```ts
const { start, stop, started, task: someTask } = useTask('some-task', (delta) => {
  // This function will be executed on every frame
})
```

## Creating a Task in a Stage

You can pass a stage that the task should be added to as an option to `useTask`,
the stage can be passed by value or key. If no stage is passed, the task will be
added to [Threlte's
`mainStage`](/docs/learn/basics/scheduling-tasks#default-stages).

```ts
useTask((delta) => {
  // This function will be executed on every frame as a
  // task in the stage `afterRenderStage`.
}, { stage: afterRenderStage })
```

## Task Dependencies

A common use case for tasks is to run code after another task has been executed. Imagine
a game where an object is transformed by user input in one task and a camera follows that
object in another task. The camera task should be executed after the object has been
transformed.

To control the order in which tasks are executed in a stage, you can pass a
`before` and `after` option to `useTask`. The tasks passed to these options are
called **dependencies** and can be a task itself, the key of a task or an array
of tasks or keys. The referenced tasks must be in the same stage as the task you
are creating.

Task dependencies **can be created in any order** if they are passed by key.
This means that you can declare a dependency (with `before` or `after`) on a
task that is created later in your code. The declared dependencies will be taken
into account when they are created later on.

<Tip type="warning"> If a task is passed by reference to the `before` or `after`
  option, the task created by `useTask` will automatically be added to the same
  stage as the task it depends on. If you pass a key instead and the task you
  want to reference is **not** in [Threlte's
  `mainStage`](/docs/learn/basics/scheduling-tasks#default-stages), you will
  also need to pass the stage, either by value or key. </Tip>

## Examples

### Starting and Stopping Tasks

By default, a task is started automatically. You can set it to not start
automatically by passing `autoStart: false` as an option to `useTask`. You can
then start and stop the task manually using the `start` and `stop` functions:

```ts
const { start, stop, started } = useTask((delta) => {
  // do something
}, { autoStart: false })

// start the task
start()

// stop the task
stop()

// check if the task is started
$: console.log($started)
```

### `useTask` and On-Demand Rendering

By default, `useTask` will automatically invalidate the current frame and
thereby request a re-render on the next frame. Most of the times, this is what
you want. However, if you want more control over when things are re-rendered,
you can pass `autoInvalidate: false` as an option to `useTask`. This will prevent
the task from automatically invalidating the current frame. You can then
invalidate the frame manually using the `invalidate` function returned by
`useThrelte`:

```ts
const { invalidate } = useThrelte()

const { start, stop, started } = useTask((delta) => {
  // do something
  // invalidate the current frame
  if (someCondition) {
    invalidate()
  }
}, { autoInvalidate: false })
```

### Update Objects

To update objects in your scene, you can use the `useTask` hook to create a task
that is executed on every frame. The delta time is passed as the first argument
to make animations frame rate independent.

```svelte
<script>
  import { T, useTask } from '@threlte/core'
  import { Mesh } from 'svelte-three'

  let mesh

  useTask((delta) => {
    if (!mesh) return
    mesh.rotation.y += delta * 0.5
  })
</script>

<T.Mesh bind:ref={mesh}>
  <T.BoxGeometry />
</T.Mesh>
```

### Custom Render Pipeline

To create a custom render pipeline, add a task to Threlte's
[`renderStage`](/docs/learn/basics/scheduling-tasks#default-stages) which by
default only runs its tasks when a re-render is needed. Be sure to set the
property `autoRender` to `false` on the `<Canvas>` component **or inside the
`<Renderer>` component** to prevent Threlte from automatically rendering your
scene.

```svelte title="CustomRenderer.svelte"
<script>
  import { useTask, useThrelte } from '@threlte/core'
  import { onMount } from 'svelte'

  const { renderStage, autoRender } = useThrelte()

  // disable auto rendering
  onMount(() => {
    let before = autoRender.current
    autoRender.set(false)
    return () => autoRender.set(before)
  })

  useTask((delta) => {
    // render your scene here
  }, { stage: renderStage, autoInvalidate: false })
</script>
```

### Post Processing

This example demonstrates how to use `useTask` to implement post processing
effects using the library
[`postprocessing`](https://github.com/pmndrs/postprocessing).

1. Create a `<Renderer>` component. Be sure to set the option `autoInvalidate`
of `useTask` to `false` to prevent Threlte from automatically invalidating the
render stage.

```svelte title="Renderer.svelte"
<script>
  import { useThrelte, useTask } from '@threlte/core'
  import { onMount } from 'svelte'
  import {
    EffectComposer,
    EffectPass,
    RenderPass,
    SMAAEffect,
    SMAAPreset,
    BloomEffect,
    KernelSize
  } from 'postprocessing'

  const { scene, renderer, camera, size } = useThrelte()

  // Adapt the default WebGLRenderer: https://github.com/pmndrs/postprocessing#usage
  const composer = new EffectComposer(renderer)

  const setupEffectComposer = (camera) => {
    composer.removeAllPasses()
    composer.addPass(new RenderPass(scene, camera))
    composer.addPass(
      new EffectPass(
        camera,
        new BloomEffect({
          intensity: 1,
          luminanceThreshold: 0.15,
          height: 512,
          width: 512,
          luminanceSmoothing: 0.08,
          mipmapBlur: true,
          kernelSize: KernelSize.MEDIUM
        })
      )
    )
    composer.addPass(
      new EffectPass(
        camera,
        new SMAAEffect({
          preset: SMAAPreset.LOW
        })
      )
    )
  }

  // We need to set up the passes according to the camera in use
  $: setupEffectComposer($camera)
  $: composer.setSize($size.width, $size.height)

  const { renderStage, autoRender } = useThrelte()

  // We need to disable auto rendering as soon as this component is
  // mounted and restore the previous state when it is unmounted.
  onMount(() => {
    let before = autoRender.current
    autoRender.set(false)
    return () => autoRender.set(before)
  })

  useTask((delta) => {
    composer.render(delta)
  }, { stage: renderStage, autoInvalidate: false })
</script>
```

2. Use the `<Renderer>` component in your app. To disable automatic rendering of
your scene, Set `autoRender` to `false` on the `<Canvas>` component.

```svelte title="App.svelte"
<script>
  import { Canvas } from '@threlte/svelte'
  import Renderer from './Renderer.svelte'
</script>

<Canvas>
  <Renderer />
</Canvas>
```

<Tip type="warning">
  When using SvelteKit (or more broadly, SSR) be sure to add `ssr: { noExternal: ['postprocessing' ]}` to your `vite.config.js`.
