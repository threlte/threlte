This example shows how to include user-generated random terrain as a fixed `<RigidBody>`, within a Rapier world.

This is an adaption of Rapier's [own demo](https://rapier.rs/demos3d/index.html) (select "Demo: triangle mesh").

<Example path="geometry/physics-terrain" />

### How does it work

1. Similar to the [3D noise example](/docs/examples/geometry/terrain), loop over the vertices of a PlaneGeometry, and use a noise map to create a heightfield array `heights`.
2. Attach the heightfield to a rapier `<Collider>`

```svelte
<Collider
  shape={'heightfield'}
  args={[nsubdivs, nsubdivs, heights, scale]}
/>
```

3. Wrap in a fixed `<RigidBody>`. We don't want this terrain to respond to gravity and fall downwards when rapier physics simulation begins.

```svelte
<RigidBody type={'fixed'}>
  <Collider ... />
</RigidBody>
```

4. Add some falling random shapes to the scene to prove that the terrain is functioning properly (see "FallingShapes.svelte")

- define some shapes in an array

  - geometry
  - `<AutoCollider>` type
  - color

- fill an array of 50 items with a random shape, with a random position and rotation, and loop over it in markup
- add a `<T.Mesh>` to the scene, provide it with the chosen geometry, and a material with the chosen color
- wrap that in an `<AutoColliders>` with the chosen AutoCollider
- wrap in a `'dynamic'` `<RigidBody>`. Dynamic because we want these shapes to fall in the scene according to gravity.
- finally, wrap in a `<T.Group>` to set our random position and rotation
